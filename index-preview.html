<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disparities in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders: Does Where You Live Matter?;,citation_abstract=This study focused on (1) whether disparities in timely receipt of substance use services can be explained in part by the characteristics of the community in which the clients reside and (2) whether the effect of community characteristics on timely receipt of services was similar across racial/ethnic groups. The sample was composed of adults receiving publicly funded outpatient treatment in Washington State. Treatment data were linked to data from the US census. The outcome studied was “Initiation and Engagement” in treatment (IET), a measure noting timely receipt of services at the beginning of treatment. Community characteristics studied included community level economic disadvantage and concentration of American Indian, Latino, and Black residents in the community. Black and American Indian clients were less likely to initiate or engage in treatment compared to non-Latino white clients, and American Indian clients living in economically disadvantaged communities were at even greater risk of not initiating treatment. Community economic disadvantage and racial/ethnic makeup of the community were associated with treatment initiation, but not engagement, although they did not entirely explain the disparities found in IET.;,citation_author=Andrea Acevedo;,citation_author=Lee Panas;,citation_author=Deborah Garnick;,citation_author=Dolores Acevedo-Garcia;,citation_author=Jennifer Miles;,citation_author=Grant Ritter;,citation_author=Kevin Campbell;,citation_publication_date=2018-10;,citation_cover_date=2018-10;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11414-018-9586-y;,citation_issn=1556-3308;,citation_volume=45;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Behavioral Health Services &amp;amp;amp; Research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of a machine learning framework to predict substance use disorder treatment success;,citation_abstract=There are several methods for building prediction models. The wealth of currently available modeling techniques usually forces the researcher to judge, a priori, what will likely be the best method. Super learning (SL) is a methodology that facilitates this decision by combining all identified prediction algorithms pertinent for a particular prediction problem. SL generates a final model that is at least as good as any of the other models considered for predicting the outcome. The overarching aim of this work is to introduce SL to analysts and practitioners. This work compares the performance of logistic regression, penalized regression, random forests, deep learning neural networks, and SL to predict successful substance use disorders (SUD) treatment. A nationwide database including 99,013 SUD treatment patients was used. All algorithms were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a test sample that was not included in the training sample used to fit the prediction models. AUC for the models ranged between 0.793 and 0.820. SL was superior to all but one of the algorithms compared. An explanation of SL steps is provided. SL is the first step in targeted learning, an analytic framework that yields double robust effect estimation and inference with fewer assumptions than the usual parametric methods. Different aspects of SL depending on the context, its function within the targeted learning framework, and the benefits of this methodology in the addiction field are discussed.;,citation_author=Laura Acion;,citation_author=Diana Kelmansky;,citation_author=Mark Laan;,citation_author=Ethan Sahker;,citation_author=DeShauna Jones;,citation_author=Stephan Arndt;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0175383;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_pmid=28394905;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PloS One;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cost-effectiveness of Internet-Delivered vs In-Person Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Children and Adolescents With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;,citation_abstract=Therapist-guided, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment option for children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder, but to our knowledge, its cost-effectiveness compared with traditional in-person treatment has not been established.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy implemented within a stepped-care model compared with in-person cognitive behavioral therapy for young people with obsessive-compulsive disorder.This economic evaluation of a randomized noninferiority trial conducted at 2 specialist obsessive-compulsive disorder clinics in Sweden enrolled 152 children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years with obsessive-compulsive disorder, mainly through clinician referrals (110 [72%]). Recruitment began October 6, 2017, and ended May 24, 2019. Follow-up ended April 14, 2020.Participants were randomly assigned to receive either guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or in-person cognitive behavioral therapy during a 16-week period. At the 3-month follow-up, nonresponders in both groups were offered additional in-person cognitive behavior therapy sessions.Health outcomes were treatment response rates (primary outcome), remission rates, and quality-adjusted life-years. Cost data were collected before treatment, after treatment, at 3-month follow-up, and at 6-month follow-up (primary end point) and are presented in 2020 US dollars. The differences in incremental costs and health outcomes were compared between the groups and presented from the health care professional, health care sector, and societal perspectives.A total of 152 participants (94 girls [62%]; mean [SD] age, 13.4 [2.5] years) were randomized; 151 (99%) completed the trial. At the 6-month follow-up, 50 of 74 participants (68%) in the stepped-care group and 52 of 77 participants (68%) in the in-person cognitive behavioral therapy group were classified as treatment responders (odds ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.51-1.98]; P = .99). Health economic analyses showed that the stepped-care group used fewer therapist resources than the in-person cognitive behavioral therapy group, resulting in a mean cost savings of $2104 (95% CI, $1202-$3006) per participant for the full study period of 10 months, corresponding to a relative savings of 39%. The cost savings remained largely comparable when taking wider health care sector and societal perspectives.This study suggests that, for young people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a low-cost digital intervention followed by in-person treatment for nonresponders was cost-effective compared with in-person cognitive behavior therapy alone.;,citation_author=Kristina Aspvall;,citation_author=Filipa Sampaio;,citation_author=Fabian Lenhard;,citation_author=Karin Melin;,citation_author=Lisa Norlin;,citation_author=Eva Serlachius;,citation_author=David Mataix-Cols;,citation_author=Erik Andersson;,citation_publication_date=2021-07;,citation_cover_date=2021-07;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.18516;,citation_issn=2574-3805;,citation_volume=4;,citation_journal_title=JAMA Network Open;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Behavioral Modeling in Weight Loss Interventions;,citation_abstract=Designing systems with human agents is difficult because it often requires models that characterize agents’ responses to changes in the system’s states and inputs. An example of this scenario occurs when designing treatments for obesity. While weight loss interventions through increasing physical activity and modifying diet have found success in reducing individuals’ weight, such programs are difficult to maintain over long periods of time due to lack of patient adherence. A promising approach to increase adherence is through the personalization of treatments to each patient. In this paper, we make a contribution towards treatment personalization by developing a framework for predictive modeling using utility functions that depend upon both time-varying system states and motivational states evolving according to some modeled process corresponding to qualitative social science models of behavior change. Computing the predictive model requires solving a bilevel program, which we reformulate as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This reformulation provides the first (to our knowledge) formulation for Bayesian inference that uses empirical histograms as prior distributions. We study the predictive ability of our framework using a data set from a weight loss intervention, and our predictive model is validated by comparison to standard machine learning approaches. We conclude by describing how our predictive model could be used for optimization, unlike standard machine learning approaches which cannot.;,citation_author=Anil Aswani;,citation_author=Philip Kaminsky;,citation_author=Yonantan Mintz;,citation_author=Elena Flowers;,citation_author=Yoshimi Fukuoka;,citation_publication_date=2019-02;,citation_cover_date=2019-02;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2018.07.011;,citation_issn=0377-2217;,citation_pmid=30778275;,citation_volume=272;,citation_journal_title=European journal of operational research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile phone sensors and supervised machine learning to identify alcohol use events in young adults: Implications for just-in-time adaptive interventions;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day’s drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.;,citation_author=Sangwon Bae;,citation_author=Tammy Chung;,citation_author=Denzil Ferreira;,citation_author=Anind K.

Evidence-based practice and modular therapies allow a level of flexibility within intervention delivery without formal changes and not all changes to therapy should be considered as a new/adapted treatment but instead regarded as “metacompetence”. Implementing existing interventions in new contexts is preferable to developing new interventions in many instances. New guidance outlines how researchers can adapt and transfer interventions to varied contexts. Summary&nbsp; The review provides proposed definitions of different changes to therapy. Modified and personalized treatments may improve acceptability to patients whilst maximizing implementation of evidence-based practice within clinical services.;,citation_author=Sophie D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Agreement between self-reported illicit drug use and biological samples: A systematic review and meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Background and Aims Studies often rely upon self-report and biological testing methods for measuring illicit drug use, although evidence for their agreement is limited to specific populations and self-report instruments. We aimed to examine comprehensively the evidence for agreement between self-reported and biologically measured illicit drug use among all major illicit drug classes, biological indicators, populations and settings. Methods We systematically searched peer-reviewed databases (Medline, Embase and PsycINFO) and grey literature. Included studies reported 2  2 table counts or agreement estimates comparing self-reported and biologically measured use published up to March 2022. With biological results considered to be the reference standard and use of random-effect regression models, we evaluated pooled estimates for overall agreement (primary outcome), sensitivity, specificity, false omission rates (proportion reporting no use that test positive) and false discovery rates (proportion reporting use that test negative) by drug class, potential consequences attached to self-report (i.e. work, legal or treatment impacts) and time-frame of use. Heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting forest plots. Results From 7924 studies, we extracted data from 207 eligible studies. Overall agreement ranged from good to excellent ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ 0.79). False omission rates were generally low, while false discovery rates varied by setting. Specificity was generally high but sensitivity varied by drug, sample type and setting. Self-report in clinical trials and situations of no consequences was generally reliable. For urine, recent (i.e. past 1–4 days) self-report produced lower sensitivity and false discovery rates than past month. Agreement was higher in studies that informed participants biological testing would occur (diagnostic odds ratio = 2.91, 95% confidence interval = 1.25–6.78). The main source of bias was biological assessments (51% studies). Conclusions While there are limitations associated with self-report and biological testing to measure illicit drug use, overall agreement between the two methods is high, suggesting both provide good measures of illicit drug use. Recommended methods of biological testing are more likely to provide reliable measures of recent use if there are problems with self-disclosure.;,citation_author=Chrianna Bharat;,citation_author=Paige Webb;,citation_author=Zachary Wilkinson;,citation_author=Rebecca McKetin;,citation_author=Jason Grebely;,citation_author=Michael Farrell;,citation_author=Adam Holland;,citation_author=Matthew Hickman;,citation_author=Lucy Thi Tran;,citation_author=Brodie Clark;,citation_author=Amy Peacock;,citation_author=Shane Darke;,citation_author=Jih-Heng Li;,citation_author=Louisa Degenhardt;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1111/add.16200;,citation_issn=1360-0443;,citation_volume=118;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Addiction;">

The micro-randomised trial is an experimental approach for optimising and adapting m-Health resources. This trial design provides data to construct and optimise m-Health interventions. The data can be used to inform when and what type of m-Health interventions should be initiated, and thus serve to integrate interventions into daily routines with precision.

Our main independent variables were physician specialty and year groupings (2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010).The percentage of psychiatrists who accepted private noncapitated insurance in 2009-2010 was significantly lower than the percentage of physicians in other specialties (55.3% [95% CI, 46.7%-63.8%] vs 88.7% [86.4%-90.7%]; P &amp;amp;amp;lt; .001) and had declined by 17.0% since 2005-2006.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A learning theory perspective on lapse, relapse, and the maintenance of behavior change;,citation_abstract=Behavior change processes studied in the learning laboratory, such as extinction and counterconditioning, do not involve destruction of the original learning. Instead, they often result in new behavior that is strongly dependent on the current context, whether provided by external cues, internal state, recent events, or time. Lapse and relapse effects may therefore occur after various manipulations of the context. Theory and preliminary evidence suggests that long-term maintenance of changed behavior may be promoted by a number of factors, including situating the new learning in the most relevant contexts, providing retrieval cues after the new learning is complete, and varying the contexts in which the new learning takes place. Furthermore, because original learning is often more context free than the learning that replaces it, the most efficient way to reduce risk behavior in the general population may be to find ways to ensure that healthy behaviors and attitudes are learned first.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relative Efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention, Standard Relapse Prevention, and Treatment as Usual for Substance Use Disorders;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE Relapse is highly prevalent following substance abuse treatments, highlighting the need for improved aftercare interventions. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), a group-based psychosocial aftercare, integrates evidence-based practices from mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention (RP) approaches. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term efficacy of MBRP in reducing relapse compared with RP and treatment as usual (TAU [12-step programming and psychoeducation]) during a 12-month follow-up period. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between October 2009 and July 2012, a total of 286 eligible individuals who successfully completed initial treatment for substance use disorders at a private, nonprofit treatment facility were randomized to MBRP, RP, or TAU aftercare and monitored for 12 months. Participants medically cleared for continuing care were aged 18 to 70 years; 71.5% were male and 42.1% were of ethnic/racial minority. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weekly group sessions of MBRP, cognitive-behavioral RP, or TAU. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes included relapse to drug use and heavy drinking as well as frequency of substance use in the past 90 days. Variables were assessed at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up points. Measures used included self-report of relapse and urinalysis drug and alcohol screenings. RESULTS Compared with TAU, participants assigned to MBRP and RP reported significantly lower risk of relapse to substance use and heavy drinking and, among those who used substances, significantly fewer days of substance use and heavy drinking at the 6-month follow-up. Cognitive-behavioral RP showed an advantage over MBRP in time to first drug use. At the 12-month follow-up, MBRP participants reported significantly fewer days of substance use and significantly decreased heavy drinking compared with RP and TAU. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For individuals in aftercare following initial treatment for substance use disorders, RP and MBRP, compared with TAU, produced significantly reduced relapse risk to drug use and heavy drinking. Relapse prevention delayed time to first drug use at 6-month follow-up, with MBRP and RP participants who used alcohol also reporting significantly fewer heavy drinking days compared with TAU participants. At 12-month follow-up, MBRP offered added benefit over RP and TAU in reducing drug use and heavy drinking. Targeted mindfulness practices may support long-term outcomes by strengthening the ability to monitor and skillfully cope with discomfort associated with craving or negative affect, thus supporting long-term outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse and relapse prevention;,citation_abstract=Abstract Most psychological disorders and problem behaviors are characterized by very high rates of postremittance relapse. Thus, advances in the long-term efficacy of psychological interventions require understanding the causes and processes of relapse, with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that reduce the probability of relapse. Existing psychological theory and interventions relevant to relapse and relapse prevention (RP) are reviewed, with a focus on addictive behaviors. The past two decades have produced increased attention toward the relapse problem and important advances in the conceptualization of relapse (i.e., as a process rather than a discrete event). Further progress will require the translation of basic theory into applied theory, the development of integrative theories of relapse, and the design and testing of theory-based, multimodal RP interventions.;,citation_author=Thomas H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trajectories of craving during medication-assisted treatment for opioid-use disorder: Subtyping for early identification of higher risk;,citation_abstract=Aims To examine evidence for subtypes of opioid craving trajectories during medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and to (a) test whether these subtypes differed on MOUD-related outcomes, and (b) determine whether nonresponders could be identified before treatment initiation. Design, setting, and participants Outpatients (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;211) being treated with buprenorphine or methadone for up to 16 weeks. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify unobserved craving-trajectory subtypes. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were trained to predict subtype membership from pretreatment data. Measurements Self-reported opioid craving (Ecological Momentary Assessment – EMA – three random moments per day). Participant-initiated EMA reports of drug use or higher-than-usual stress. Addiction Severity Index (ASI) pretreatment. Findings Four craving trajectories were identified: Low (73%); High and Increasing (HIC) (10.9%); Increasing and Decreasing (8.5%); and Rapidly Declining (7.6%). The HIC subgroup reported the highest use of heroin, any opiate, and cannabis during treatment. The Low Craving subgroup reported the lowest use of heroin or any opiate use, and the lowest levels of stress and drug-cue exposure during treatment. SVM models predicting HIC membership before treatment initiation had a sensitivity of 0.70, specificity of 0.78, and accuracy of 0.77. Including 3 weeks of EMA reports increased sensitivity to 0.78, specificity to 0.84, and accuracy to 0.85. Conclusions Subgroups of MOUD patients show distinct patterns of opioid craving during treatment. Subgroups differ on critical outcomes including drug-use lapse, stress, and exposure to drug cues.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using Intensive Longitudinal Data Collected via Mobile Phone to Detect Imminent Lapse in Smokers Undergoing a Scheduled Quit Attempt;,citation_abstract=Background: Mobile phone based real-time ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) have been used to record health risk behaviors, and antecedents to those behaviors, as they occur in near real time. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if intensive longitudinal data, collected via mobile phone, could be used to identify imminent risk for smoking lapse among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers seeking smoking cessation treatment. Methods: Participants were recruited into a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial at an urban safety-net hospital tobacco cessation clinic. All participants completed in-person EMAs on mobile phones provided by the study. The presence of six commonly cited lapse risk variables (ie, urge to smoke, stress, recent alcohol consumption, interaction with someone smoking, cessation motivation, and cigarette availability) collected during 2152 prompted or self-initiated postcessation EMAs was examined to determine whether the number of lapse risk factors was greater when lapse was imminent (ie, within 4 hours) than when lapse was not imminent. Various strategies were used to weight variables in efforts to improve the predictive utility of the lapse risk estimator. Results: Participants (N=92) were mostly female (52/92, 57%), minority (65/92, 71%), 51.9 (SD 7.4) years old, and smoked 18.0 (SD 8.5) cigarettes per day. EMA data indicated significantly higher urges (P=.01), stress (P=.002), alcohol consumption (P$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001), interaction with someone smoking (P$&amp;lt;$.001), and lower cessation motivation (P=.03) within 4 hours of the first lapse compared with EMAs collected when lapse was not imminent. Further, the total number of lapse risk factors present within 4 hours of lapse (mean 2.43, SD 1.37) was significantly higher than the number of lapse risk factors present during periods when lapse was not imminent (mean 1.35, SD 1.04), P$<$.001. Overall, 62% (32/52) of all participants who lapsed completed at least one EMA wherein they reported $\geq$3 lapse risk factors within 4 hours of their first lapse. Differentially weighting lapse risk variables resulted in an improved risk estimator (weighted area=0.76 vs unweighted area=0.72, P$<$.004). Specifically, 80% (42/52) of all participants who lapsed had at least one EMA with a lapse risk score above the cut-off within 4 hours of their first lapse.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Internet-delivered treatment for substance abuse: A multisite randomized controlled trial;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Computer-delivered interventions have the potential to improve access to quality addiction treatment care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Therapeutic Education System (TES), an Internet-delivered behavioral intervention that includes motivational incentives, as a clinician-extender in the treatment of substance use disorders. METHOD: Adult men and women (N=507) entering 10 outpatient addiction treatment programs were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of either treatment as usual (N=252) or treatment as usual plus TES, with the intervention substituting for about 2 hours of standard care per week (N=255). TES consists of 62 computerized interactive modules covering skills for achieving and maintaining abstinence, plus prize-based motivational incentives contingent on abstinence and treatment adherence. Treatment as usual consisted of individual and group counseling at the participating programs. The primary outcome measures were abstinence from drugs and heavy drinking (measured by twice-weekly urine drug screens and self-report) and time to dropout from treatment. RESULTS: Compared with patients in the treatment-as-usual group, those in the TES group had a lower dropout rate (hazard ratio=0.72, 95% CI=0.57, 0.92) and a greater abstinence rate (odds ratio=1.62, 95% CI=1.12, 2.35). This effect was more pronounced among patients who had a positive urine drug or breath alcohol screen at study entry (N=228) (odds ratio=2.18, 95% CI=1.30, 3.68). CONCLUSIONS: Internet-delivered interventions such as TES have the potential to expand access and improve addiction treatment outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive behavioral interventions for alcohol and drug use disorders: Through the stage model and back again;,citation_abstract=Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches have among the highest level of empirical support for the treatment of drug and alcohol use disorders. As Psychology of Addictive Behaviors marks its 30th anniversary, we review the evolution of CBT for the addictions through the lens of the Stage Model of Behavioral Therapies Development. The large evidence base from Stage II randomized clinical trials indicates a modest effect size with evidence of relatively durable effects, but limited diffusion in clinical practice, as is the case for most empirically validated approaches for mental health and addictive disorders. Technology may provide a means for CBT interventions to circumvent the &amp;amp;amp;quot;implementation cliff&amp;quot; in Stages III-V by offering a flexible, low-cost, standardized means of disseminating CBT in a range of novel settings and populations. Moreover, returning to Stage I to reconnect clinical applications of CBT to recent developments in cognitive science and neuroscience holds great promise for accelerating understanding of mechanisms of action. It is critical that CBT not be considered as a static intervention, but rather 1 that constantly evolves and is refined through the stage model until the field achieves a maximally powerful intervention that addresses core features of the addictions.

Addiction-comprehensive health enhancement support system (A-CHESS) is a smartphone application that aims to reduce relapse. To offer targeted support to patients who are at risk of lapses within the coming week, a Bayesian network model to predict such events was constructed using responses on 2,934 weekly surveys (called the Weekly Check-in) from 152 alcohol-dependent individuals who recently completed residential treatment. The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service, provided in A-CHESS, to track patients’ recovery progress. The model showed good predictability, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.829 in the 10-fold cross-validation and 0.912 in the external validation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment use, perceived need, and barriers to seeking treatment for substance abuse and mental health problems among older adults compared to younger adults;,citation_abstract=Background This study examined age group differences in and correlates of treatment use and perceived treatment need for substance use disorders (SUD) and mental health (MH) problems as well as self-reported barriers to treatment among people 65+ years old vs. 26–34, 35–49, and 50–64 years old. Methods Data are from the 2008 to 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (N=96,966). Age group differences were examined using descriptive bivariate analyses and binary logistic regression analyses. Results The 65+ age group was least likely to use treatment and perceive treatment need, but the 50–64 age group was more similar to the younger age groups than the 65+ age group. Controlling for age, other predisposing, and enabling factors, alcohol and illicit drug dependence and comorbid SUD and MH problems increased the odds of SUD treatment use. Of MH problems, anxiety disorder had the largest odds for MH treatment use. Bivariate analyses showed that lack of readiness to stop using and cost/limited insurance were the most frequent barriers to SUD and MH treatment, respectively, among older adults, and they were less likely than younger age groups to report stigma/confidentiality concerns for MH treatment. Conclusions Older adults will become a larger portion of the total U.S. population with SUD and/or MH problems.

To explore this question, the authors conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with therapists. The interview texts were analyzed using a structured thematic coding system. A central theme in the interviews was a culture clash between managed care companies and these therapists. Working for managed care organizations demanded several practices that violated the therapists’ standard of care and professional ethics. Also, participants reported that managed care personnel misrepresented the nature of psychotherapy to clients, thereby undermining the therapeutic work and the therapist-client relationship.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Factors associated with patterns of mobile technology use among persons who inject drugs;,citation_abstract=Background New and innovative methods of delivering interventions are needed to further reduce risky behaviors and increase overall health among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have potential for reaching PWID; however, little is known about mobile technology use (MTU) in this population. In this study, the authors identify patterns of MTU and identified factors associated with MTU among a cohort of PWID. Methods Data were collected through a longitudinal cohort study examining drug use, risk behaviors, and health status among PWID in San Diego, California. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to define patterns of MTU (i.e., making voice calls, text messaging, and mobile Internet access). Multinomial logistic regression was then used to identify demographic characteristics, risk behaviors, and health indicators associated with mobile technology use class. Results In LCA, a 4-class solution fit the data best. Class 1 was defined by low MTU (22%, n = 100); class 2, by PWID who accessed the Internet using a mobile device but did not use voice or text messaging (20%, n = 95); class 3, by primarily voice, text, and connected Internet use (17%, n = 91); and class 4, by high MTU (41%, n = 175). Compared with low MTU, high MTU class members were more likely to be younger, have higher socioeconomic status, sell drugs, and inject methamphetamine daily. Conclusion The majority of PWID in San Diego use mobile technology for voice, text, and/or Internet access, indicating that rapid uptake of mHealth interventions may be possible in this population. However, low ownership and use of mobile technology among older and/or homeless individuals will need to be considered when implementing mHealth interventions among PWID.;,citation_author=Kelly M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD): The TRIPOD statement;,citation_abstract=Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web based survey and revised during a three day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document.

Significant measures were entered as candidate variables to predict quit status. The resulting decision trees were used to predict cessation outcomes in a validation cohort. Results: In the training cohort, the decision trees significantly improved on chance classification of smoking status following treatment and at 6-month follow-up. The first split of all decision trees, which was delay discounting, significantly improved on chance classification rates in both the training and validation cohort. Delay discounting emerged as the single best predictor of group CBT treatment response with an average baseline discount rate of ln(k) = -7.1, correctly predicting smoking status of 80% of participants at posttreatment and 81% of participants at follow-up.

Causal attributions both for maintaining abstinence and for smoking in hypothetical high-risk situations were obtained prior to quitting from participants in a smoking cessation program. After treatment, subjects who relapsed also provided retrospective causal attributions for initial smoking episodes. Results showed that participants who relapsed following a slip reported significantly higher AVEs (more internal, stable, and global causal attributions) than those who regained abstinence following a slip. Furthermore, the AVE emerged as the strongest predictor of subsequent smoking when included in a discriminant analysis along with other factors associated with the initial smoking episode.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evolution of the global smoking epidemic over the past half century: Strengthening the evidence base for policy action;,citation_abstract=Background Despite compelling evidence on the health hazards of tobacco products accumulated over the past 70 years, smoking remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Policy action to control smoking requires timely, comprehensive, and comparable evidence on smoking levels within and across countries. This study provides a recent assessment of that evidence based on the methods used in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study. Methods We estimated annual prevalence of, and mortality attributable to smoking any form of tobacco from 1970 to 2020 and 1990–2020, respectively, using the methods and data sources (including 3431 surveys and studies) from the GBD collaboration. We modelled annual prevalence of current and former smoking, distributions of cigarette-equivalents per smoker per day, pack-years for current smoking, years since cessation for former smokers and estimated population-attributable fractions due to smoking. Results Globally, adult smoking prevalence in 2020 was 32.6% (32.2% to 33.1%) and 6.5% (6.3% to 6.7%) among men and women, respectively. 1.18 (0.94 to 1.47) billion people regularly smoke tobacco, causing 7.0 (2.0 to 11.2) million deaths in 2020. Smoking prevalence has declined by 27.2% (26.0% to 28.3%) for men since 1990, and by 37.9% (35.3% to 40.1%) for women. Declines have been largest in the higher sociodemographic countries, falling by more than 40% in some high-income countries, and also in several Latin American countries, notably Brazil, where prevalence has fallen by 70% since 1990. Smoking prevalence for women has declined substantially in some countries, including Nepal, the Netherlands and Denmark, and remains low throughout Asia and Africa. Conversely, there has been little decline in smoking in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with over half of all men continuing to smoke in large populations in Asia (China, Indonesia), as well as the Pacific Islands. Implications While global smoking prevalence has fallen, smoking is still common and causes a significant health burden worldwide. The unequal pace of declines across the globe is shifting the epidemic progressively to LMICs. Smoking is likely to remain a leading cause of preventable death throughout this century unless smoking cessation efforts can significantly and rapidly reduce the number of smokers, particularly in Asia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Depression From a Precision Mental Health Perspective: Utilizing Personalized Conceptualizations to Guide Personalized Treatments;,citation_abstract=$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$p$&amp;gt;$Modern research has proven that the “typical patient” requiring standardized treatments does not exist, reflecting the need for more personalized approaches for managing individual clinical profiles rather than broad diagnoses. In this regard, precision psychiatry has emerged focusing on enhancing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders through identifying clinical subgroups, suggesting personalized evidence-based interventions, assessing the effectiveness of different interventions, and identifying risk and protective factors for remission, relapse, and vulnerability. Literature shows that recent advances in the field of precision psychiatry are rapidly becoming more data-driven reflecting both the significance and the continuous need for translational research in mental health. Different etiologies underlying depression have been theorized and some factors have been identified including neural circuitry, biotypes, biopsychosocial markers, genetics, and metabolomics which have shown to explain individual differences in pathology and response to treatment. Although the precision approach may prove to enhance diagnosis and treatment decisions, major challenges are hindering its clinical translation. These include the clinical diversity of psychiatric disorders, the technical complexity and costs of multiomics data, and the need for specialized training in precision health for healthcare staff, besides ethical concerns such as protecting the privacy and security of patients’ data and maintaining health equity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General. Executive Summary;,citation_abstract=This first Report of the Surgeon General on Mental Health represents the initial step in advancing the notion that mental health is fundamental to general health. It states that a review of research on mental health revealed two findings. First, the efficacy of treatment is well documented, and second, a range of treatment exists for most mental disorders. The report provides the opportunity to dispel the myths and stigma surrounding mental illness. It encourages individuals to seek treatment when they find themselves experiencing signs and symptoms of mental distress. Chapter 1 elaborates on the themes of the report and describes criteria applied to the scientific evidence cited. Chapter 2 was written to provide background information to help persons from outside the health field better understand the topics. Chapter 3 details normal development, provides overview of risk factors and prevention, and provides overview of mental disorders in children. Chapter 4 reviews the current state of knowledge about mental health in adults, along with selected disorders. Chapter 5 reviews normal developmental milestones of aging and then considers mental disorders in older people. Chapter 6 examines what recent research has revealed about the organizing and financing of mental health services, as well as cost and quality of those services. Chapter 7 discusses the values underlying confidentiality, its importance in individual decisions to seek mental health treatment, and the legal framework governing confidentiality and potential problems with this framework. Chapter 8 reiterates the need to establish mental health as a cornerstone of general health, to place mental health treatment in the mainstream of health care services, and to ensure access to care.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The history, current status, and possible future of precision mental health;,citation_abstract=In evidence-based mental health practice, decisions must often be made for which there is little or no empirical basis. A common example of this is when there are multiple empirically supported interventions for a person with a given diagnosis, where the aim is to recommend the treatment most likely to be effective for that person. Data obtained from randomized clinical trials allow for the identification of patient characteristics that could be used to match patients to treatments. Historically, researchers have focused on individual moderators, single variables that interact statistically with treatment type, but these have rarely proved powerful enough to inform treatment decisions. Recently, researchers have begun to explore ways in which the use of multivariable algorithms might improve clinical decision-making. Common pitfalls have been identified, including the use of methods that provide overoptimistic estimates of the gains that can be expected from the applications of an algorithm in a clinical setting. It is too early to tell if these efforts will pay off and, if so, how much their use can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health systems.

This study examined the influence of smartphone-delivered in-the-moment coping strategies on drinking after experiencing a craving among participants utilizing the Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A). The LBMI-A was utilized by 28 adults (18 to 45 years old) who met criteria for an alcohol use disorder and were interested in changing their drinking. Participants utilized the system for 6 weeks and responded to a daily interview of craving, type of LBMI-A coping strategy utilized in response, and whether or not they subsequently drank. Mixed model analyses of 744 total observations revealed that craving cue type, craving strength, and coping strategies were significantly related to drinking in response to a craving. Results suggested that coping strategies delivered by the LBMI-A (i.e., listening to an urge surfing audio file, viewing reasons for changing drinking) were superior to using a non-LBMI-A strategy. Simple contrast analyses indicated that cues related to being around alcohol and time of day were the most potent elicitors of subsequent drinking. Results suggest smartphone-delivered coping strategies for alcohol cravings are effective in reducing craving cued drinking and that craving cues related to drinking environments and drinking times of day represent fruitful areas of intervention focus.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Classifying smoking urges via machine learning;,citation_abstract=Background and objective Smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and diseases in the developed world, and advances in modern electronics and machine learning can help us deliver real-time intervention to smokers in novel ways. In this paper, we examine different machine learning approaches to use situational features associated with having or not having urges to smoke during a quit attempt in order to accurately classify high-urge states. Methods To test our machine learning approaches, specifically, Bayes, discriminant analysis and decision tree learning methods, we used a dataset collected from over 300 participants who had initiated a quit attempt. The three classification approaches are evaluated observing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision. Results The outcome of the analysis showed that algorithms based on feature selection make it possible to obtain high classification rates with only a few features selected from the entire dataset. The classification tree method outperformed the naive Bayes and discriminant analysis methods, with an accuracy of the classifications up to 86%. These numbers suggest that machine learning may be a suitable approach to deal with smoking cessation matters, and to predict smoking urges, outlining a potential use for mobile health applications. Conclusions In conclusion, machine learning classifiers can help identify smoking situations, and the search for the best features and classifier parameters significantly improves the algorithms’ performance. In addition, this study also supports the usefulness of new technologies in improving the effect of smoking cessation interventions, the management of time and patients by therapists, and thus the optimization of available health care resources. Future studies should focus on providing more adaptive and personalized support to people who really need it, in a minimum amount of time by developing novel expert systems capable of delivering real-time interventions.;,citation_author=Antoine Dumortier;,citation_author=Ellen Beckjord;,citation_author=Saul Shiffman;,citation_author=Ervin Sejdić;,citation_publication_date=2016-12;,citation_cover_date=2016-12;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.09.016;,citation_issn=0169-2607;,citation_volume=137;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tension reduction and affect regulation: An examination of mood indices on drinking and non-drinking days among university student drinkers;,citation_abstract=Several theories posit problematic alcohol use develops through mechanisms of positive and negative reinforcement. However, the literature on these mechanisms remains inconsistent. This may be due to a number of issues including a failure to disaggregate negative mood or a failure to account for mood functioning (i.e., stability in mood). Alternatively, there may be differences in typical postdrinking/evening mood on drinking and nondrinking days, however, this has yet to be fully explored. We examined multiple indices of distinct mood states prior to and after typical drinking onset times on drinking and nondrinking days using ecological momentary assessment. College student drinkers (n = 102) carried personal data devices for 15 days. They reported on mood and alcohol use several times per day. Tonic positive mood was higher on drinking days than nondrinking days prior to typical drinking initiation. After typical drinking times, positive mood was higher on drinking days than nondrinking days. Similarly, negative moods (anxiety, stress, anger, and stress instability) indicated a pattern of lower levels relative to both predrinking mood on drinking days, and matched mood time-points on nondrinking days; though, not all of these differences were statistically different. Results suggest positive and negative reinforcing mechanisms may be at play—though the negative reinforcement effects may manifest through subjectively “better” mood on drinking versus nondrinking days.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotion differentiation in early recovery from alcohol use disorder: Associations with in-the-moment affect and 3-month drinking outcomes;,citation_abstract=Background Early recovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD) is commonly associated with high levels of negative affect, stress, and emotional vulnerability, which confer significant relapse risk. Emotion differentiation—the ability to distinguish between discrete emotions—has been shown to predict relapse after treatment for a drug use disorder, but this relationship has not been explored in individuals recovering from AUD. Methods The current study used thrice daily random and up to thrice daily self-initiated ecological momentary assessment surveys (N = 42, observations = 915) to examine whether 1) moments of high affective arousal are characterized by momentary differences in emotion differentiation among individuals in the first year of a current AUD recovery attempt, and 2) individuals’ average emotion differentiation would predict subsequent alcohol use measured by the timeline follow-back over a 3-month follow-up period. Results Multilevel models showed that moments (Level 1) of higher-than-average negative affect (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001) and/or stress (p = 0.033) were characterized by less negative emotion differentiation, while moments of higher-than-average positive affect were characterized by greater positive emotion differentiation (p $&amp;lt;$ 0.001). At the between-person level (Level 2), participants with higher stress overall had lower negative emotion differentiation (p = 0.009). Linear regression showed that average negative, but not positive, emotion differentiation was inversely associated with percent drinking days over the subsequent 3-month follow-up period (p = 0.042). Neither form of average emotion differentiation was associated with drinking quantity. Conclusions We found that for individuals in early AUD recovery, affective states are associated with acute shifts in the capacity for emotion differentiation. Further, we found that average negative emotion differentiation prospectively predicts subsequent alcohol use.;,citation_author=Noah N. Emery;,citation_author=Kyle J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting Smoking Events with a Time-Varying Semi-Parametric Hawkes Process Model;,citation_abstract=Health risks from cigarette smoking — the leading cause of preventable death in the United States — can be substantially reduced by quitting. Although most smokers are motivated to quit, the majority of quit attempts fail. A number of studies have explored the role of self-reported symptoms, physiologic measurements, and environmental context on smoking risk, but less work has focused on the temporal dynamics of smoking events, including daily patterns and related nicotine effects. In this work, we examine these dynamics and improve risk prediction by modeling smoking as a self-triggering process, in which previous smoking events modify current risk. Specifically, we fit smoking events self-reported by 42 smokers to a time-varying semi-parametric Hawkes process (TV-SPHP) developed for this purpose. Results show that the TV-SPHP achieves superior prediction performance compared to related and existing models, with the incorporation of time-varying predictors having greatest benefit over longer prediction windows. Moreover, the impact function illustrates previously unknown temporal dynamics of smoking, with possible connections to nicotine metabolism to be explored in future work through a randomized study design. By more effectively predicting smoking events and exploring a self-triggering component of smoking risk, this work supports development of novel or improved cessation interventions that aim to reduce death from smoking.;,citation_author=Matthew Engelhard;,citation_author=Hongteng Xu;,citation_author=Lawrence Carin;,citation_author=Jason A Oliver;,citation_author=Matthew Hallyburton;,citation_author=F Joseph McClernon;,citation_publication_date=2018-08;,citation_cover_date=2018-08;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issn=2640-3498;,citation_pmid=30899917;,citation_volume=85;,citation_journal_title=Proceedings of machine learning research;">

However, a comprehensive assessment of alcohol-attributable deaths among this population, including from partially alcohol-attributable causes, is lacking.To estimate the mean annual number of deaths from excessive alcohol use relative to total deaths among adults aged 20 to 64 years overall; by sex, age group, and state; and as a proportion of total deaths.This population-based cross-sectional study of mean annual alcohol-attributable deaths among US residents between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019, used population-attributable fractions. Data were analyzed from January 6, 2021, to May 2, 2022.Mean daily alcohol consumption among the 2 089 287 respondents to the 2015-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was adjusted using national per capita alcohol sales to correct for underreporting. Adjusted mean daily alcohol consumption prevalence estimates were applied to relative risks to generate alcohol-attributable fractions for chronic partially alcohol-attributable conditions. Alcohol-attributable fractions based on blood alcohol concentrations were used to assess acute partially alcohol-attributable deaths.Alcohol-attributable deaths for 58 causes of death, as defined in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Alcohol-Related Disease Impact application. Mortality data were from the National Vital Statistics System.During the 2015-2019 study period, of 694 660 mean deaths per year among adults aged 20 to 64 years (men: 432 575 [66.3%]; women: 262 085 [37.7%]), an estimated 12.9% (89 697 per year) were attributable to excessive alcohol consumption. This percentage was higher among men (15.0%) than women (9.4%). By state, alcohol-attributable deaths ranged from 9.3% of total deaths in Mississippi to 21.7% in New Mexico. Among adults aged 20 to 49 years, alcohol-attributable deaths (44 981 mean annual deaths) accounted for an estimated 20.3% of total deaths.The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that an estimated 1 in 8 total deaths among US adults aged 20 to 64 years were attributable to excessive alcohol use, including 1 in 5 deaths among adults aged 20 to 49 years.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drinking context, alcohol use, and subjective responses during binge drinking episodes measured by high-resolution ecological momentary assessment (HR-EMA);,citation_abstract=Objective: Subjective responses to alcohol play a key role in the development and maintenance of risky drinking and alcohol use disorder (AUD). The social and environmental context where drinking occurs may moderate alcohol’s subjective effects, but ecologically valid studies of these associations are limited. The present study used high-resolution ecological momentary assessment (HR-EMA) targeting real-world binge drinking episodes to examine associations among drinking context, alcohol consumption, and subjective responses to alcohol. Method: Young adult heavy drinkers (N = 61; 57% male) completed two smartphone-based, 3-hr HR-EMA of drinking context (social context and location), alcohol use, and subjective responses (alcohol stimulation, sedation, feeling, liking, and wanting more). Analyses examined the associations between drinking context and subjective alcohol responses, accounting for demographic characteristics and individual differences in alcohol consumption. Results: Most (85%) participants reported binge drinking during real-world drinking events. Estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) and alcohol stimulation and reward (liking, wanting) were greater when participants drank with others (vs. alone) and in a bar/restaurant (vs. other location). Sedation was higher when drinking alone versus with others. Conclusions: The present study extends prior laboratory-based research and shows that subjective responses during naturalistic binge drinking episodes may be influenced by drinking context. Drinking with others and in bars and restaurants may increase alcohol consumption, enhance alcohol’s rewarding effects, and lead to more alcohol-related harm in at-risk drinkers.

Design and Measurements:&nbsp; Buprenorphine providers within a 25-mile radius of the county with the highest drug-related death rates within the 10 states with the highest drug-related death rates were identified and called to determine whether the provider worked there, prescribed buprenorphine, accepted insurance, had appointments, or charged for visits. Results:&nbsp; The number of providers listed in each county ranged from 1 to 166, with 5 counties having $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$10 providers. In 3 counties no appointments were obtained, and another 3 counties had $\leq$3 providers with availability. Of the 505 providers listed, 355 providers (70.3%) were reached, 310 (61.4%) of the 505 listings were correct numbers, and 195 (38.6%) of the 505 providers in the listings provided buprenorphine.

Wait times for appointments ranged from 1 to 120 days, with an average of 16.8 days for those that had a waitlist. Among the 39 providers who reported out-of-pocket costs, the average cost was $231 (range: $90 to $600). One hundred forty of the 505 providers listed in the database had appointments available (27.7%).

Economic burden estimates that describe the impact of the crisis are needed when considering federal and state resources devoted to addressing overdoses. In this study, we estimate the societal costs for opioid use disorder and fatal overdose from all opioids in 2017. Methods We estimated costs of fatal overdose from all opioids and opioid use disorder based on the incidence of overdose deaths and the prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder for 2017. Incidence of fatal opioid overdose was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System; prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder was estimated from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Costs were estimated for health care, criminal justice and lost productivity. Costs for the reduced quality of life for opioid use disorder and life lost due to fatal opioid overdose were valued using U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for valuing reductions in morbidity and mortality. Results Costs for opioid use disorder and fatal opioid overdose in 2017 were estimated to be $1.02 trillion. The majority of the economic burden is due to reduced quality of life from opioid use disorder and the value of life lost due to fatal opioid overdose. Conclusions These estimates can assist decision makers in understanding the magnitude of opioid use disorder and fatal overdose.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol subjective responses in heavy drinkers: Measuring acute effects in the natural environment versus the controlled laboratory setting;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: For decades, laboratory alcohol challenges have been the &amp;amp;amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; for measuring individual differences in alcohol’s subjective effects. However, these approaches are expensive and labor-intensive, making them impractical for large-scale use. This study examined the reliability and validity of a new high-resolution EMA (HR-EMA) ambulatory approach to assessing alcohol use and subjective responses in drinkers’ natural environments. METHODS: Participants were 83 young adult heavy social drinkers (58% male; mean&nbsp;&nbsp;SD age&nbsp;=&nbsp;25.4&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6&nbsp;years) who completed up to two smartphone-based, 3-h HR-EMA assessments of alcohol use and related subjective responses in their typical drinking environments. Reported alcohol consumption during the HR-EMA periods was used to calculate estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC). Subjective effects were measured using the Brief Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (B-BAES) and Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ). All participants also completed identical measures during a separate, 4 to 5-h laboratory session in which they received a 0.8&nbsp;g/kg alcohol challenge. RESULTS: Most natural environment drinking episodes (87%) met or exceeded the threshold for binge drinking (final mean eBAC&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.12&nbsp;g/dl). Associations between reported alcohol use and subjective responses on the B-BAES and DEQ were strongest earlier in the drinking events, with fair reliability of reported subjective effects across two HR-EMA episodes (intraclass correlation [ICC] range = 0.46-0.49). There was fair-to-good correspondence between HR-EMA- and laboratory-derived subjective responses (ICC range = 0.49-0.74), even after accounting for differences in alcohol consumption and drinking context. Reported stimulating and rewarding alcohol effects were higher in the ambulatory than laboratory setting, and vice versa for sedating effects. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the reliability and validity of smartphone-based HR-EMA to measure alcohol use and subjective responses in heavy drinkers’ natural environments. These findings lend support to the use of ambulatory HR-EMA as a measure of alcohol subjective responses in risky drinkers when a laboratory protocol is not practical, feasible, or safe.;,citation_author=Daniel J.

Overall and primary use of the major illicit drugs (heroin, powder or crack cocaine and marijuana) are considered separately. “Need–service match” means that a patient rated a service as important at intake and reported its receipt during treatment. “Percentage of needs matched” indicates the proportion of five service domains (medical, mental health, family, vocational and housing) so matched. Findings In mixed regression models controlling for multiple factors, a greater percentage of needs matched tended to improve primary ($\beta$ = 0.028, P = 0.09) and overall ($\beta$ = 0.049, P = 0.05) drug use in the follow-up year. Exclusion of treatment duration as a covariate doubled the magnitude of these coefficients. The benefits of matching were concentrated among the half of patients reporting needs in four to five rather than one to three domains, and were strongest among patients in long-term residential facilities. Addressing vocational and housing needs exerted the greatest effects. Conclusions Matching comprehensive services to needs is a useful addiction treatment practice, especially for high-need patients. Treatment duration might partially mediate its effect.;,citation_author=Peter D. Friedmann;,citation_author=James C. Hendrickson;,citation_author=Dean R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stress Allostasis in Substance Use Disorders: Promise, Progress, and Emerging Priorities in Clinical Research;,citation_abstract=Clinicians and researchers alike have long believed that stressors play a pivotal etiologic role in risk, maintenance, and/or relapse of alcohol and other substance use disorders (SUDs). Numerous seminal and contemporary theories on SUD etiology posit that stressors may motivate drug use and that individuals who use drugs chronically may display altered responses to stressors. We use foundational basic stress biology research as a lens through which to evaluate critically the available evidence to support these key stress–SUD theses in humans. Additionally, we examine the field’s success to date in targeting stressors and stressor reactivity in treatments for SUDs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The impact of the Medicare mental health coverage gap on rural mental health care access;,citation_abstract=Medicare insures a growing number of individuals who may benefit from mental health services. Medicare mental health provider policy, last updated in 1989, excludes a significant proportion of the master’s-level mental health workforce, resulting in what has been described as the Medicare mental health coverage gap (MMHCG; Fullen, Wiley, &amp;amp;amp; Morgan, 2019). Based on existing provider shortages in rural areas, Medicare provider policy may be particularly burdensome for accessing care in rural areas. The authors analyzed MMHCG data from 3,760 counselors, including 601 who reside in Health Resources &amp; Services Administration-designated rural localities. A total of 78.0% (n = 469) of rural counselors reported being directly impacted by the MMHCG, compared with 68.6% (n = 2,167) of nonrural counselors ($\chi^2$ = 21.47, p pro bono services ($\chi^2$ = 11.05, p $&amp;lt;$ .001, OR = 1.35, 95% CI [1.13, 1.61]) due to the MMHCG. Based on these data, the MMHCG has an outsized impact on rural mental health providers and rural communities. Implications of the MMHCG for rural mental health care, including how it exacerbates barriers to mental health access and burdens rural mental health providers, are discussed.

Methods We conducted secondary data analyses of the A-CHESS randomized controlled trial. Recruitment occurred in five residential treatment programs operated by two addiction treatment organizations. Participants were 349 adults with alcohol use disorders recruited two weeks before discharge from residential treatment. We provided intervention arm participants with a smartphone, the A-CHESS application, and an 8-month service plan. Control arm participants received treatment as usual. Telephone interviews at 4, 8, and 12-month follow-ups assessed past-month risky drinking days, past-month abstinence, and post-discharge service utilization (past-month outpatient addiction treatment and past-week mutual help including Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous). Using mixed effects latent variable models, we estimated the indirect effects of A-CHESS on drinking outcomes, as mediated by post-discharge service utilization. Results Approximately 50.5% of participants reported outpatient addiction treatment and 75.5% reported mutual help at any follow-up interview in the year following randomization. Assignment to the A-CHESS intervention was associated with an increased odds of outpatient addiction treatment across follow-ups, but not mutual help. This use of outpatient addiction treatment mediated the effect of A-CHESS on risky drinking days, but not abstinence. The effect of A-CHESS through outpatient addiction treatment appeared to reduce the expected number of risky drinking days across follow-ups by 11%. Conclusions The mobile health (mHealth) intervention promoted the use of outpatient addiction treatment, which appeared to contribute to its efficacy in reducing risky drinking. Future research should investigate how mHealth interventions could link patients to needed treatment services and promote the sustained use of these services.;,citation_author=Joseph E.

In response to this call, the Houston Emergency Opioid Engagement System (HEROES) was established and created an emergency access pathway into long-term recovery for individuals with an opioid use disorder. A major contributor to the success of the program is retention of the enrolled individuals in the program. Methods: We have identified an increase in dropout from the program after 90 and 120 days. Based on more than 700 program participants, we developed a machine learning approach to predict the individualized risk for dropping out of the program. Results: Our model achieved sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.65 for dropout at 90 days and improved the performance to sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.66 for 120 days. Additionally, we identified individual risk factors for dropout, including previous overdose and relapse and improvement in reported quality of life.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Substance abuse treatment entry, retention, and outcome in women: A review of the literature;,citation_abstract=This paper reviews the literature examining characteristics associated with treatment outcome in women with substance use disorders. A search of the English language literature from 1975 to 2005 using Medline and PsycInfo databases found 280 relevant articles. Ninety percent of the studies investigating gender differences in substance abuse treatment outcomes were published since 1990, and of those, over 40% were published since the year 2000. Only 11.8% of these studies were randomized clinical trials. A convergence of evidence suggests that women with substance use disorders are less likely, over the lifetime, to enter treatment compared to their male counterparts. Once in treatment, however, gender is not a significant predictor of treatment retention, completion, or outcome. Gender-specific predictors of outcome do exist, however, and individual characteristics and treatment approaches can differentially affect outcomes by gender. While women-only treatment is not necessarily more effective than mixed-gender treatment, some greater effectiveness has been demonstrated by treatments that address problems more common to substance-abusing women or that are designed for specific subgroups of this population. There is a need to develop and test effective treatments for specific subgroups such as older women with substance use disorders, as well as those with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders such as eating disorders. Future research on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of gender-specific versus standard treatments, as well as identification of the characteristics of women and men who can benefit from mixed-gender versus single-gender treatments, would advance the field.;,citation_author=Shelly F.

Methods The authors used 13 electronic databases and manually searched the literature from January 1, 1978, to May 30, 2013. One hundred (69%) of 145 primary research articles met the inclusion criteria. Two blinded, independent reviewers scored each article. Consensus discussions and a content expert reconciled discrepancies. Results Current rates of alcohol and substance abuse among Latinos are comparable to or surpass other U.S. ethnic groups. Disparities in access and quality of care are evident between Latinos and other ethnic groups. As a heterogeneous group, Latinos vary by geographic region in terms of substance of choice and their cultural identity takes precedence over general ethnic identity as a likely determinant of substance abuse behaviors. There is growing research interest in systems influencing treatment access and adherence among racial/ethnic and gender minority groups. However, studies on Latinos’ service use and immediate treatment outcomes have been both limited in number and inconsistent in findings. Conclusions This review identified human capital, quality of care, and access to culturally responsive care as key strategies to eliminate disparities in health and treatment quality. Implications are discussed, including the need for effectiveness studies on Latinos served by systems of care that, under health care reform, are seeking to maximize resources, improve outcomes, and reduce variation in quality of care.;,citation_author=Erick G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A smartphone application to support recovery from alcoholism: A randomized clinical trial;,citation_abstract=IMPORTANCE: Patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders are not typically offered evidence-based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An unmasked randomized clinical trial involving 3 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit treatment organization in the Midwestern United States and 2 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit organization in the Northeastern United States. In total, 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment were randomized to treatment as usual (n = 179) or treatment as usual plus a smartphone (n = 170) with the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS), an application designed to improve continuing care for alcohol use disorders. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention and follow-up period lasted 8 and 4 months, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risky drinking days–the number of days during which a patient’s drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded 4 standard drinks for men and 3 standard drinks for women, with standard drink defined as one that contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol (12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits). Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. RESULTS: For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than did patients in the control group, with a mean of 1.39 vs 2.75 days (mean difference, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.46-2.27; P = .003).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Defining Recovery From Alcohol Use Disorder: Development of an NIAAA Research Definition;,citation_abstract=The objective of this article is to provide an operational definition of recovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD) to facilitate the consistency of research on recovery and stimulate further research. The construct of recovery has been difficult to operationalize in the alcohol treatment and recovery literature. Several formal definitions of recovery have been developed but have limitations because 1) they require abstinence from both alcohol and substance use, 2) they do not include the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for AUD as part of the recovery process (i.e., no focus on remission from AUD), 3) they do not link remission and cessation from heavy drinking to improvements in biopsychosocial functioning and quality-of-life constructs, and 4) they do not distinguish between alcohol and other drug use. The authors present a newly developed National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) definition of recovery from DSM-5 AUD based on qualitative feedback from key recovery stakeholders (e.g., researchers, clinicians, and recovery specialists). The definition views recovery as both a process of behavioral change and an outcome and incorporates two key components of recovery, namely, remission from DSM-5 AUD and cessation from heavy drinking, a nonabstinent recovery outcome. The NIAAA definition of recovery also emphasizes the importance of biopsychosocial functioning and quality of life in enhancing recovery outcomes. This new NIAAA definition of recovery is an operational definition that can be used by diverse stakeholders to increase consistency in recovery measurement, stimulate research to better understand recovery, and facilitate the process of recovery.;,citation_author=Brett T.

We seek to highlight modifiable barriers to these problems at the patient, therapist, treatment, organization and government-levels of analysis.

In particular, we focus on the need to continue to work toward innovation in treatment development while also solving the difficulties relating to the dissemination of EBPTs. Several relatively new concepts in the field will be discussed (implementation cliff, program drift, voltage drop and deployment treatment development) and we contrast America and England as examples of government-level processes that are in the process of major change with respect to EBPTs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Expert Consensus Survey on Digital Health Tools for Patients With Serious Mental Illness: Optimizing for User Characteristics and User Support;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Digital technology is increasingly being used to enhance health care in various areas of medicine. In the area of serious mental illness, it is important to understand the special characteristics of target users that may influence motivation and competence to use digital health tools, as well as the resources and training necessary for these patients to facilitate the use of this technology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a quantitative expert consensus survey to identify key characteristics of target users (patients and health care professionals), barriers and facilitators for appropriate use, and resources needed to optimize the use of digital health tools in patients with serious mental illness. METHODS: A panel of 40 experts in digital behavioral health who met the participation criteria completed a 19-question survey, rating predefined responses on a 9-point Likert scale. Consensus was determined using a chi-square test of score distributions across three ranges (1-3, 4-6, 7-9). Categorical ratings of first, second, or third line were designated based on the lowest category into which the CI of the mean ratings fell, with a boundary $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$6.5 for first line. Here, we report experts’ responses to nine questions (265 options) that focused on (1) user characteristics that would promote or hinder the use of digital health tools, (2) potential benefits or motivators and barriers or unintended consequences of digital health tool use, and (3) support and training for patients and health care professionals. RESULTS: Among patient characteristics most likely to promote use of digital health tools, experts endorsed interest in using state-of-the-art technology, availability of necessary resources, good occupational functioning, and perception of the tool as beneficial. Certain disease-associated signs and symptoms (eg, more severe symptoms, substance abuse problems, and a chaotic living situation) were considered likely to make it difficult for patients to use digital health tools. Enthusiasm among health care professionals for digital health tools and availability of staff and equipment to support their use were identified as variables to enable health care professionals to successfully incorporate digital health tools into their practices. The experts identified a number of potential benefits of and barriers to use of digital health tools by patients and health care professionals. Experts agreed that both health care professionals and patients would need to be trained in the use of these new technologies.

Effective smoking cessation JITAI rely on the development of accurate decision rules that determine when someone is most likely to lapse. The primary goal of the present study was to identify the strongest predictors of first lapse among smokers undergoing a quit attempt. Methods Smokers attending a clinic-based smoking cessation program (n = 74) were asked to complete ecological momentary assessments five times daily on study-provided smartphones for 4 weeks post-quit. A three-stage modeling process utilized Cox proportional hazards regression to examine time to lapse a function of 31 predictors. First, univariate models evaluated the relationship between each predictor and time to lapse. Second, the elastic net machine learning algorithm was used to select the best predictors. Third, backwards elimination further reduced the set of predictors to optimize parsimony. Results Univariate models identified seven predictors significantly related to time to lapse. The elastic net algorithm retained five: perceived odds of smoking today, confidence in ability to avoid smoking, motivation to avoid smoking, urge to smoke, and cigarette availability. The reduced model demonstrated inadequate approximation to the non-penalized baseline model. Conclusions Accurate estimation of moments of high risk for smoking lapse remains an important goal in the development of JITAI. These results demonstrate the utility of exploratory data-driven approaches to variable selection. The results of this study can inform future JITAI by highlighting targets for intervention.;,citation_author=Emily T. Hébert;,citation_author=Robert Suchting;,citation_author=Chaelin K.

The probability of these relapses (or lapses) is determined up to three days in advance using a logistic regression procedure. The study group consisted of 33 male alcohol-dependent persons, who participated in a treatment program. Clinical ratings were performed three times a week by a trained person during a visit to the clinic. The questionnaire contained 23 different items about irritation, craving for alcohol. sleep disturbances, etc. The relapses were either self-reported or detected by a biochemical marker in a urine sample that was taken daily. The most important factor for a relapse in alcohol drinking was shown to be if the patient already had had one relapse during the treatment. Other important clinical factors were the levels of irritation and autonomic disturbances. None of the variables measuring mood shifts was significant. Family conditions during childhood were the most important background variables. The predictions turned out to have a rather high specificity, but the sensitivity was lower. Half of the relapses were not predicted by an increased probability for relapse. Self-reported relapses were predictable from preceding interviews and were also less frequent compared to those detected objectively by the biochemical markers.;,citation_author=A. M.

Two small prospective studies using 6-month follow-ups of patients with alcohol use disorders (inpatient, n=51; outpatient, n=43) illustrate how cusp catastrophe theory may be used to predict relapse.

This study is a randomized clinical trial (N= 284, n= 140 in the treatment group, n= 144 in the control group) of an Internet smoking cessation intervention. Smokers were randomly assigned to receive either bupropion plus counseling alone, or bupropion and counseling in addition to 12 weeks of access to the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Smoking Cessation and Relapse Prevention (CHESS SCRP; a Web site which provided information on smoking cessation as well as support). We found that access to CHESS SCRP was not significantly related to abstinence at the end of the treatment period (OR= 1.13, 95% CI 0.66-2.62) or at 6 months postquit (OR= 1.48, 95% CI 0.66-2.62).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Receiving addiction treatment in the US: Do patient demographics, drug of choice, or substance use disorder severity matter?;,citation_abstract=Background Understanding addiction treatment needs and utilization is important to health systems and government to develop policies that effectively address substance use disorders (SUDs) at a population level. This study aims to describe differences in treatment receipt by diagnostic category, drug of choice, and demographic characteristics in an effort to identify potential disparities in receipt of care. Methods Using data from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we calculated the proportion of various groups that received treatment and conducted binary logistic regression to determine the association between addiction treatment receipt and SUD severity, drug of choice, and patient demographics. Results Using DSM-5, 16.7 million Americans (age 12 and older) are estimated to have a mild SUD, 5.2 million a moderate SUD, and 4.6 million a severe SUD. The two greatest predictors of treatment receipt are addiction severity and probation status. People with severe opioid use disorder have the greatest probability of treatment receipt with a 55.6% predicted probability of receiving treatment, while people with a mild alcohol use disorder are the least likely to receive treatment with a predicted probability of 1.8% receiving treatment. People with mild alcohol use disorder make up the largest proportion of people identified as needing but not receiving treatment when assuming all people with a diagnosis need treatment. Conclusions Improving use of existing specialty addiction treatment capacity to address the needs of the 8.5 million Americans with moderate or severe SUD and better use of the general health care system to treat mild or stable SUD may be a better focus for health system planners and government than adding new capacity for specialty treatment.;,citation_author=Kimberly Johnson;,citation_author=Khary K.

Our aim was to identify the pooled compliance rate of EMA studies in substance users and examine variables that may influence compliance with EMA protocols, such as the length and frequency of assessments. Design A meta-analysis and meta-regression of all possible studies (randomized controlled trials and longitudinal) which incorporated EMA protocols, examining substance use. Setting Studies took place from 1998 to 2017, in numerous countries world-wide.

Together, these processes inform clinical safety planning and our therapeutic tools accommodate a reasonable degree of idiosyncrasy when we individualize interventions. Unraveling these multifaceted factors and processes on a quantitative level, however, requires estimation frameworks capable of representing idiosyncrasies relevant to intervention and psychotherapy. Using, data from a 21-day ambulatory assessment protocol that included six random prompts per day, we developed personalized (i.e., idiographic) models of interacting risk factors and suicidal ideation via Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) in a sample of people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (N=95) stratified for a history of high lethality suicide attempts. Our models revealed high levels of heterogeneity in state risk factors related to suicidal ideation, with no features shared among the majority of participants or even among relatively homogenous clusters of participants (i.e., empirically derived subgroups). We discuss steps toward clinical implementation of personalized models, which can eventually capture suicidogenic changes in proximal risk factors and inform safety planning and interventions.;,citation_author=Aleksandra Kaurin;,citation_author=Alexandre Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex differences in cocaine/heroin users: Drug-use triggers and craving in daily life;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Studies of sex differences have shown that men and women with drug-use disorders differ in course and outcome and in cue-induced activation of putative brain &amp;amp;amp;quot;control network&amp;quot; areas. We evaluated sex differences in daily functioning and subjective events related to drug use with ecological momentary assessment (EMA). METHODS: EMA data were collected from cocaine- and heroin-using outpatients (72 men; 42 women) in methadone maintenance in 2-5 randomly prompted (RP) entries per day and in participant-initiated entries for heroin or cocaine use or craving, for up to 25 weeks. Urine drug screens were conducted three times weekly. Data were analyzed via repeated-measures logistic regression, using sex as a predictor of responses. RESULTS: In RP reports, women and men reported significantly different patterns of drug-cue exposure, with women significantly more likely to report having seen cocaine or been tempted to use in the past hour. Women also had higher craving after past-hour exposure to drug cues. In reports of drug use, women, compared to men, were more likely to report that they had used more cocaine than they had meant to, tended to feel guilty more often after drug use, and to have used despite trying not to use. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide real-time behavioral evidence that women respond differently than men to exposure to drug cues and to drug use, consistent with laboratory and brain-imaging findings.

It is not known how often commercially insured adults obtain follow-up treatment after nonfatal opioid overdose.To investigate the incidence of follow-up treatment following emergency department discharge after nonfatal opioid overdose and patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an administrative claims database for a large US commercial insurer, from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2019, to September 26, 2019. Adult patients discharged from the emergency department after an index opioid overdose (no overdose in the preceding 90 days) were included. Patients with cancer and without continuous insurance enrollment were excluded.The primary outcome was follow-up treatment in the 90 days following overdose, defined as a combined outcome of claims for treatment encounters or medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine and naltrexone). Analysis was stratified by whether patients received treatment for opioid use disorder in the 90 days before the overdose. Logistic regression models were used to identify patient characteristics associated with receipt of follow-up treatment. Marginal effects were used to report the average adjusted probability and absolute risk differences (ARDs) in follow-up for different patient characteristics.A total of 6451 patients were identified with nonfatal opioid overdose; the mean (SD) age was 45.0 (19.3) years, 3267 were women (50.6%), and 4676 patients (72.5%) reported their race as non-Hispanic white. A total of 1069 patients (16.6%; 95% CI, 15.7%-17.5%) obtained follow-up treatment within 90 days after the overdose. In adjusted analysis of patients who did not receive treatment before the overdose, black patients were half as likely to obtain follow-up compared with non-Hispanic white patients (ARD, -5.9%; 95% CI, -8.6% to -3.6%). Women (ARD, -1.7%; 95% CI, -3.3% to -0.5%) and Hispanic patients (ARD, -3.5%; 95% CI, -6.1% to -0.9%) were also less likely to obtain follow-up.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Preliminary Investigation of Wait Times for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in Canada;,citation_abstract=Objectives: The objectives of this study were to: 1) describe wait times at agencies providing child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in Canada; and 2) determine whether agency and waiting list characteristics are associated with wait times for different clinical priority levels. Method: A web-based survey was distributed to 379 agencies providing CAMHS in Canada. The survey contained questions about agency characteristics, waiting list characteristics and agency wait times. Pearson’s correlations were used to determine the bivariate relationship between agency and waiting list characteristics and wait times. Results: The response rate was 30.6% (n=116). Only 8.6% of agencies reported no waiting lists for their programs or services. Estimated mean wait times for initial assessment decreased with increasing levels of clinical priority. However, the ranges of wait times at each clinical priority level were substantial. In addition, only 31.4% of agencies reported being “mostly” or “always” able to meet the Canadian Psychiatric Association’s wait time benchmark for scheduled care for psychiatric services. Wait times were positively correlated with size of the waiting list for those considered at lower clinical priority. Conclusions: The findings confirm concerns about the prevalence of wait times for CAMHS in Canada, and also note marked variability. Though shorter wait times for higher priority children and youth is appropriate, current practice does not meet proposed standards of care as they relate to wait times. Future research should determine the impact of service reform efforts on reducing wait times for children with differing clinical priority levels.;,citation_author=Karolina Kowalewski;,citation_author=John D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personalized Treatment of Alcohol Dependence;,citation_abstract=Pharmacogenetic and adaptive treatment approaches can be used to personalize care for alcohol-dependent patients. Preliminary evidence shows that variation in the gene encoding the $\mu$-opioid receptor moderates the response to naltrexone when used to treat alcohol dependence. Studies have also shown moderating effects of variation in the gene encoding the serotonin transporter on response to serotonergic treatment of alcohol dependence. Adaptive algorithms that modify alcohol treatment based on patients’ progress have also shown promise. Initial response to outpatient treatment appears to be a particularly important in the selection of optimal continuing care interventions. In addition, stepped-care algorithms can reduce the cost and burden of treatment while maintaining good outcomes. Finally, matching treatment to specific problems present at intake or that emerge during treatment can also improve outcomes. Although all of these effects require replication and further refinement, the future of personalized care for alcohol dependence appears bright.;,citation_author=Henry R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Context and Craving among Individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder Attempting to Moderate Their Drinking;,citation_abstract=Many individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) prefer a goal of moderation, as they do not see their drinking as causing severe enough consequences to merit abstinence. Given that individuals attempting to moderate will continue to put themselves in contexts where drinking occurs, understanding how distinct external alcohol cues prompt craving is important for implementing the optimal treatments for individuals with AUD. Using data from a randomized controlled trial of stepped care brief interventions for AUD, this study explored the relationship between drinking contexts and craving in individuals attempting to moderate their drinking using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). At baseline, participants were asked to prospectively identify drinking contexts that were particularly likely to elicit intense craving and heavy drinking, called highly valued drinking contexts (HVCs). During EMA, participants were asked to report three times a day (morning, afternoon, evening) on their non-mutually-exclusive contexts and their level of craving. Using multilevel modeling, all drinking contexts were tested as concurrent predictors of craving across the 84 days of the study. Next, AUD severity was tested as a moderator of HVC on craving. Results demonstrated that being in an HVC corresponded to greater reports of any craving and intensity of craving, over and above the influences of several other contextual factors (e.g., negative affect and already drinking). AUD severity significantly moderated HVC’s impact on any craving, such that greater AUD severity potentiated HVC’s already high odds of any craving. Implications for treatments for individuals with AUD are discussed.;,citation_author=Alexis N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond sigmoids: How to obtain well-calibrated probabilities from binary classifiers with beta calibration;,citation_abstract=For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic sigmoidal curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier. In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of parametric calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior to logistic calibration for a wide range of classifiers: Naive Bayes, Adaboost, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron. If the original classifier is already calibrated, then beta calibration learns a function close to the identity. On this we build a statistical test to recognise if the model deviates from being well-calibrated.;,citation_author=Meelis Kull;,citation_author=Telmo M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital Mental Health Interventions for Depression, Anxiety, and Enhancement of Psychological Well-Being Among College Students: Systematic Review;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: College students are increasingly reporting common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and they frequently encounter barriers to seeking traditional mental health treatments. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via the Web and apps, offer the potential to improve access to mental health treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the literature on digital mental health interventions focused on depression, anxiety, and enhancement of psychological well-being among samples of college students to identify the effectiveness, usability, acceptability, uptake, and adoption of such programs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (registration number CRD42018092800), and the search strategy was conducted by a medical research librarian in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EbscoHost), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) from the date of inception to April 2019. Data were synthesized using a systematic narrative synthesis framework, and formal quality assessments were conducted to address the risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 89 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of interventions (71/89, 80%) were delivered via a website, and the most common intervention was internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (28, 31%). Many programs (33, 37%) featured human support in the form of coaching. The majority of programs were either effective (42, 47%) or partially effective (30, 34%) in producing beneficial changes in the main psychological outcome variables. Approximately half of the studies (45, 51%) did not present any usability or acceptability outcomes, and few studies (4, 4%) examined a broad implementation of digital mental health interventions on college campuses. Quality assessments revealed a moderate-to-severe risk of bias in many of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that digital mental health interventions can be effective for improving depression, anxiety, and psychological well-being among college students, but more rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the effective elements of these interventions. Continued research on improving the user experience of, and thus user engagement with, these programs appears vital for the sustainable implementation of digital mental health interventions on college campuses.;,citation_author=Emily G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A systematic review of rural-specific barriers to medication treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States;,citation_abstract=Opioid-related deaths have risen dramatically in rural communities. Prior studies highlight few medication treatment providers for opioid use disorder in rural communities, though literature has yet to examine rural-specific treatment barriers. We conducted a systematic review to highlight the state of knowledge around rural medication treatment for opioid use disorder, identify consumer- and provider-focused treatment barriers, and discuss rural-specific implications. We systematically reviewed the literature using PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases (January 2018). Articles meeting inclusion criteria involved rural samples or urban/rural comparisons targeting outpatient medication treatment for opioid use disorder, and were conducted in the U.S. to minimize healthcare differences. Our analysis categorized consumer- and/or provider-focused barriers, and coded barriers as related to treatment availability, accessibility, and/or acceptability. Eighteen articles met inclusion, 15 which addressed consumer-focused barriers, while seven articles reported provider-focused barriers. Availability barriers were most commonly reported across consumer (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10) and provider (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;5) studies, and included the lack of clinics/providers, backup, and resources. Acceptability barriers, described in three consumer and five provider studies, identified negative provider attitudes about addiction treatment, and providers’ perceptions of treatment as unsatisfactory for rural patients. Finally, accessibility barriers related to travel and cost were detailed in four consumer-focused studies whereas two provider-focused studies identified time constraints. Our findings consistently identified a lack of medication providers and rural-specific implementation challenges. This review highlights a lack of rural-focused studies involving consumer participants, treatment outcomes, or barriers impacting underserved populations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.;,citation_author=Scott M.

However, owing to the inherent complexity of machine learning methods, they are prone to misuse. Because of the flexibility in specifying machine learning models, the results are often insufficiently reported in research articles, hindering reliable assessment of model validity and consistent interpretation of model outputs. OBJECTIVE: To attain a set of guidelines on the use of machine learning predictive models within clinical settings to make sure the models are correctly applied and sufficiently reported so that true discoveries can be distinguished from random coincidence. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of machine learning experts, clinicians, and traditional statisticians were interviewed, using an iterative process in accordance with the Delphi method. RESULTS: The process produced a set of guidelines that consists of (1) a list of reporting items to be included in a research article and (2) a set of practical sequential steps for developing predictive models.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Meta-Analysis of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Alcohol or Other Drug Use Disorders: Treatment Efficacy by Contrast Condition;,citation_abstract=Objective. This meta-analysis examined 30 randomized controlled trials (32 study sites; 35 study arms) that tested the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for alcohol or other drug use disorders (AUD/SUD). The study aim was to provide estimates of efficacy against three levels of experimental contrast (i.e., minimal [k = 5]; non-specific therapy [k = 11]; specific therapy [k = 19]) for consumption frequency and quantity outcomes at early (1 – 6 months [kes = 41]) and late (8+ months [kes = 26]) follow-up time points. When pooled effect sizes were statistically heterogeneous, study-level moderators were examined. Method. The inverse-variance weighted effect size was calculated for each study and pooled under random effects assumptions. Sensitivity analyses included tests of heterogeneity, study influence, and publication bias. Results. CBT in contrast to minimal treatment showed a moderate and significant effect size that was consistent across outcome type and follow-up. When CBT was contrasted with a non-specific therapy or treatment as usual, treatment effect was statistically significant for consumption frequency and quantity at early, but not late, follow-up. CBT effects in contrast to a specific therapy were consistently non-significant across outcomes and follow-up time points. Of ten pooled effect sizes examined, two showed moderate heterogeneity, but multivariate analyses revealed few systematic predictors of between-study variance. Conclusions. The current meta-analysis shows that CBT is more effective than a no treatment, minimal treatment, or non-specific control. Consistent with findings on other evidence-based therapies, CBT did not show superior efficacy in contrast to another specific modality.;,citation_author=Molly Magill;,citation_author=Lara Ray;,citation_author=Brian Kiluk;,citation_author=Ariel Hoadley;,citation_author=Michael Bernstein;,citation_author=J.

This article provides a review of the evidence supporting the use of CBT, clinical elements of its application, novel treatment strategies for improving treatment response, and dissemination efforts. Although CBT for substance abuse is characterized by heterogeneous treatment elements—such as operant learning strategies, cognitive and motivational elements, and skills building interventions—across protocols several core elements emerge that focus on overcoming the powerfully reinforcing effects of psychoactive substances.

In this critical review, we provide an overview of sex/gender differences in the biology, epidemiology and treatment of SUDs. Biological sex differences are evident across an array of systems, including brain structure and function, endocrine function, and metabolic function. Gender (i.e., environmentally and socioculturally defined roles for men and women) also contributes to the initiation and course of substance use and SUDs. Adverse medical, psychiatric, and functional consequences associated with SUDs are often more severe in women. However, men and women do not substantively differ with respect to SUD treatment outcomes. Although several trends are beginning to emerge in the literature, findings on sex and gender differences in SUDs are complicated by the interacting contributions of biological and environmental factors. Future research is needed to further elucidate sex and gender differences, especially focusing on hormonal factors in SUD course and treatment outcomes; research translating findings between animal and human models; and gender differences in understudied populations, such as those with co-occurring psychiatric disorders and gender-specific populations, such as pregnant women.;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Efficacy and comparative effectiveness of telephone and smartphone remote continuing care interventions for alcohol use disorder: A randomized controlled trial;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Management of alcohol use disorder (AUD) could be enhanced by effective remote treatments. This study tested whether supplementing intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) with continuing care delivered via (1) telephone, (2) smartphone or (3) their combination improves outcomes relative to (4) IOP only. Continuing care conditions were also compared. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of four groups with 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 18-month follow-ups. SETTING: University research center in Philadelphia, PA, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n&nbsp;= 262) met DSM-V criteria for AUD, were largely male (71%) and African American (82%). INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: Telephone monitoring and counseling (TMC; n&nbsp;= 59), addiction comprehensive health enhancement support system (ACHESS; n&nbsp;= 68) and TMC + ACHESS (n&nbsp;= 70) provided for 12 months. The control condition received IOP only (TAU; n&nbsp;= 65). MEASUREMENT: The primary outcome was percentage of days heavy drinking (PDHD) in months 1-12. Secondary outcomes were any drinking, any drug use, drinking consequences and quality of life. FINDINGS: Mean PDHD in months 1-12 was 10.29 in TAU, 5.41 in TMC, 6.80 in ACHESS and 5.99 in TMC + ACHESS. PDHD was lower in TMC [Cohen’s d = 0.35, P = 0.018, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (-1.42, -0.20)], ACHESS [d = 0.31, P = 0.031, 95% CI = (-1.27, -0.06)] and TMC + ACHESS [d = 0.36, P = 0.009, 95% CI = (-1.40, -0.20)] than in TAU. Differences between TMC + ACHESS, TMC and ACHESS were small (d $\leq$ 0.06) and non-significant. Findings were inconclusive as to whether or not the treatment conditions differed on PDHD at 18 months. A significant effect was obtained on any drinking, which was higher in months 1-12 in TAU than in TMC [odds ratio (OR) = 3.02, standard error (SE) = 0.43, 95% CI = (1.30, 6.99), P = 0.01] and TMC + ACHESS [OR = 2.43, SE = 0.39, 95% CI = (1.12, 5.27), P = 0.025). No other significant effects were obtained on other secondary outcomes during or after treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impact of Continuing Care on Recovery From Substance Use Disorder;,citation_abstract=Continuing care is widely believed to be an important component of effective treatment for substance use disorder, particularly for those individuals with greater problem severity. The purpose of this review was to examine the research literature on continuing care for alcohol and drug use disorders, including studies that addressed efficacy, moderators, mechanisms of action, and economic impact. This narrative review first considered findings from prior reviews (published through 2014), followed by a more detailed examination of studies published more recently. The review found that research has generally supported the efficacy of continuing care for both adolescents and adults, but the picture is complex. Reviews find relatively small effects when results from individual studies are combined. However, continuing care of longer duration that includes more active efforts to keep patients engaged may produce more consistently positive results. Moreover, patients at higher risk for relapse may benefit to a greater degree from continuing care. Several newer approaches for the provision of continuing care show promise. These include incentives for abstinence and automated mobile health interventions to augment more conventional counselor-delivered interventions. Primary care can be used to provide medications for opioid and alcohol use disorders over extended periods, although more research is needed to determine the optimal mix of behavioral treatments and other psychosocial services in this setting. Regardless of the intervention selected for use, the status of most patients will change and evolve over time, and interventions need to include provisions to assess patients on a regular basis and to change or adapt treatment when warranted.;,citation_author=James R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment use, sources of payment, and financial barriers to treatment among individuals with opioid use disorder following the national implementation of the ACA;,citation_abstract=Introduction Despite increasing rates of opioid misuse and hospitalizations, rates of treatment for those with opioid use disorder (OUD) are very low. This study examined the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) insurance expansion on improving rates of insurance, health care access, and treatment for those with OUD. Methods Data on individuals ages 18–64 with OUD come from the 2008–2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N=4100). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the trends of health care insurance, treatment and barriers to care across the stages of ACA implementation: pre-ACA (2008–2009), partial-ACA (2010–2013), and national implementation (2014). All models were adjusted for predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Results In both adjusted and unadjusted comparisons, national implementation of the ACA was associated with significant improvements in outcome measures for those with OUD. Multivariable analyses indicate that, after national implementation, those with OUD were significantly less likely to be uninsured and were less likely to report financial barriers as a reason for not receiving substance use treatment, relative to the pre-ACA period. Individuals were also more likely to receive substance use treatment and were more likely to report that insurance paid for treatment after national implementation of the ACA relative to the pre-ACA period. These results persisted when national implementation was compared relative to partial-implementation. Conclusions National implementation of the ACA has helped to reduce rates of uninsurance, barriers to care, and improve rates of substance use treatment for those with OUD.;,citation_author=Ryan M.

Overall, the intervention resulted in a 57% reduction in drinking within 6 wks, which was maintained at 1 yr. Clients receiving immediate checkup showed significant reduction in drinking relative to controls. The 2 counseling styles were discriminable on therapist behaviors coded from audiotapes. The directive-confrontational style yielded significantly more resistance from clients, which in turn predicted poorer outcomes at 1 yr. Therapist styles did not differ in overall impact on drinking, but a single therapist behavior was predictive (r=.65) of 1-yr outcome such that the more the therapist confronted, the more the client drank.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Model Cards for Model Reporting;,citation_abstract=Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.;,citation_author=Margaret Mitchell;,citation_author=Simone Wu;,citation_author=Andrew Zaldivar;,citation_author=Parker Barnes;,citation_author=Lucy Vasserman;,citation_author=Ben Hutchinson;,citation_author=Elena Spitzer;,citation_author=Inioluwa Deborah Raji;,citation_author=Timnit Gebru;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993;,citation_doi=10.1145/3287560.3287596;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prospective Prediction of Lapses in Opioid Use Disorder: Protocol for a Personal Sensing Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Successful long-term recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) requires continuous lapse risk monitoring and appropriate use and adaptation of recovery-supportive behaviors as lapse risk changes. Available treatments often fail to support long-term recovery by failing to account for the dynamic nature of long-term recovery. Objective: The aim of this protocol paper is to describe research that aims to develop a highly contextualized lapse risk prediction model that forecasts the ongoing probability of lapse. Methods: The participants will include 480 US adults in their first year of recovery from OUD. Participants will report lapses and provide data relevant to lapse risk for a year with a digital therapeutic smartphone app through both self-report and passive personal sensing methods (eg, cellular communications and geolocation). The lapse risk prediction model will be developed using contemporary rigorous machine learning methods that optimize prediction in new data.

This paper presents the argument that automated self-help evidence-based Internet interventions meet the above criteria and can contribute to the reduction of health disparities worldwide. Proof-of-concept studies show that evidence-based Internet interventions can reach hundreds of thousands of people worldwide and could be used in public sector settings to augment existing offerings and provide services not currently available (such as prevention interventions). This paper presents a framework for systematically filling in a matrix composed of columns representing common health problems and rows representing languages. To bring the benefits of evidence-based Internet interventions to the underserved, public sector clinics should establish eHealth resource centers, through which patients could be screened online for common disorders and provided with evidence-based Internet intervention services not currently available at the clinics. These resources should be available in the patients’ languages, in formats that do not require literacy, and that can be accessed with mobile devices. Such evidence-based Internet interventions should then be shared with public sector clinics as well as individuals anywhere in the world. Finally, this paper addresses sustainability and describes a continuum of evidence-based Internet interventions to share nationally and across the world. This approach to expanding health service delivery will significantly contribute to a reduction of health disparities worldwide, adding to the often-quoted slogan, &quot;Think globally, act locally,&quot; a third line: &quot;Share globally.&quot;;,citation_author=Ricardo F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Building health behavior models to guide the development of just-in-time adaptive interventions: A pragmatic framework;,citation_abstract=Advances in wireless devices and mobile technology offer many opportunities for delivering just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs)–suites of interventions that adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and circumstances with the goal to address the individual’s need for support, whenever this need arises. A major challenge confronting behavioral scientists aiming to develop a JITAI concerns the selection and integration of existing empirical, theoretical and practical evidence into a scientific model that can inform the construction of a JITAI and help identify scientific gaps. The purpose of this paper is to establish a pragmatic framework that can be used to organize existing evidence into a useful model for JITAI construction. This framework involves clarifying the conceptual purpose of a JITAI, namely the provision of just-in-time support via adaptation, as well as describing the components of a JITAI and articulating a list of concrete questions to guide the establishment of a useful model for JITAI construction. The proposed framework includes an organizing scheme for translating the relatively static scientific models underlying many health behavior interventions into a more dynamic model that better incorporates the element of time. This framework will help to guide the next generation of empirical work to support the creation of effective JITAIs.;,citation_author=Inbal Nahum-Shani;,citation_author=Eric B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in Mobile Health: Key Components and Design Principles for Ongoing Health Behavior Support;,citation_abstract=Background: The just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an intervention design aiming to provide the right type/amount of support, at the right time, by adapting to an individual’s changing internal and contextual state. The availability of increasingly powerful mobile and sensing technologies underpins the use of JITAIs to support health behavior, as in such a setting an individual’s state can change rapidly, unexpectedly, and in his/her natural environment. Purpose: Despite the increasing use and appeal of JITAIs, a major gap exists between the growing technological capabilities for delivering JITAIs and research on the development and evaluation of these interventions. Many JITAIs have been developed with minimal use of empirical evidence, theory, or accepted treatment guidelines. Here, we take an essential first step towards bridging this gap. Methods: Building on health behavior theories and the extant literature on JITAIs, we clarify the scientific motivation for JITAIs, define their fundamental components, and highlight design principles related to these components. Examples of JITAIs from various domains of health behavior research are used for illustration. Conclusions: As we enter a new era of technological capacity for delivering JITAIs, it is critical that researchers develop sophisticated and nuanced health behavior theories capable of guiding the construction of such interventions. Particular attention has to be given to better understanding the implications of providing timely and ecologically sound support for intervention adherence and retention.;,citation_author=Inbal Nahum-Shani;,citation_author=Shawna N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Factors Contributing to Clinician Burnout and Professional Well-Being;,citation_abstract=This chapter describes the potentially modifiable contributory factors for which there is evidence supporting either a direct association or a strong indirect relationship with clinician burnout. The chapter first elaborates on the relationships between the factors that contribute to burnout and the committee’s systems model for burnout and professional well-being (see Chapter 2). The second section discusses the evidence for contributory factors, starting with work system factors related to the demands and resources of a clinician’s job, followed by the individual (clinician) factors that mediate burnout. Many of these contributory factors are under the control of the health care organization, which largely decides how work will be performed. In addition to the direct negative impact of high job demands and low job resources on burnout, the job demands–resources model suggests that job resources can offset the adverse effects of increased job demands (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007, 2017; Demerouti et al., 2001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=User Engagement in Mental Health Apps: A Review of Measurement, Reporting, and Validity;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Despite the potential benefits of mobile mental health apps, real-world results indicate engagement issues because of low uptake and sustained use. This review examined how studies have measured and reported on user engagement indicators (UEIs) for mental health apps. METHODS: A systematic review of multiple databases was performed in July 2018 for studies of mental health apps for depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety that reported on UEIs, namely usability, user satisfaction, acceptability, and feasibility. The subjective and objective criteria used to assess UEIs, among other data, were extracted from each study. RESULTS: Of 925 results, 40 studies were eligible. Every study reported positive results for the usability, satisfaction, acceptability, or feasibility of the app. Of the 40 studies, 36 (90%) employed 371 indistinct subjective criteria that were assessed with surveys, interviews, or both, and 23 studies used custom subjective scales, rather than preexisting standardized assessment tools. A total of 25 studies (63%) used objective criteria-with 71 indistinct measures. No two studies used the same combination of subjective or objective criteria to assess UEIs of the app. CONCLUSIONS: The high heterogeneity and use of custom criteria to assess mental health apps in terms of usability, user satisfaction, acceptability, or feasibility present a challenge for understanding real-world low uptake of these apps. Every study reviewed claimed that UEIs for the app were rated highly, which suggests a need for the field to focus on engagement by creating reporting standards and more carefully considering claims.;,citation_author=Michelle M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Healthcare coverage and service access for low-income adults with substance use disorders;,citation_abstract=Introduction Although health coverage facilitates service access to adults in the general population, uncertainty exists over the extent to which this relationship extends to low-income adults with substance use disorders. Methods The health status and service use patterns of low-income adults with substance use disorders who had continuous, discontinuous, and no past year health coverage were compared using data from the 2015–2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The NSDUH is a nationally representative survey of the civilian non-institutionalized population. Results In the weighted sample (unweighted n&nbsp;=&nbsp;9243), approximately 65.66% of low-income adults with substance use disorders had continuous coverage, 17.03% had discontinuous coverage, and 17.31% had no insurance coverage during the past year. Although few group differences were observed in self-reported health status, the uninsured group compared to the discontinously and continuously covered groups, respectively, was less likely to report a past year substance use treatment visit (11.03% vs. 14.83% vs. 15.61%), an outpatient care visit (53.39% vs. 71.27% vs. 79.04%), an emergency department visit (33.33% vs. 45.76% vs. 45.57%), or an inpatient admission (9.24% vs. 15.11% vs. 15.58%). Conclusions Although the cross sectional design limits causal inferences, the correlations between lacking health insurance and low rates of substance use treatment and healthcare use raise the possibility that increasing healthcare coverage might increase access to substance use treatment and other needed healthcare services for low-income adults with substance use disorders.;,citation_author=Mark Olfson;,citation_author=Christine Mauro;,citation_author=Melanie M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fairness in Machine Learning;,citation_abstract=Machine learning based systems are reaching society at large and in many aspects of everyday life. This phenomenon has been accompanied by concerns about the ethical issues that may arise from the adoption of these technologies. ML fairness is a recently established area of machine learning that studies how to ensure that biases in the data and model inaccuracies do not lead to models that treat individuals unfavorably on the basis of characteristics such as e.g. race, gender, disabilities, and sexual or political orientation. In this manuscript, we discuss some of the limitations present in the current reasoning about fairness and in methods that deal with it, and describe some work done by the authors to address them. More specifically, we show how causal Bayesian networks can play an important role to reason about and deal with fairness, especially in complex unfairness scenarios. We describe how optimal transport theory can be leveraged to develop methods that impose constraints on the full shapes of distributions corresponding to different sensitive attributes, overcoming the limitation of most approaches that approximate fairness desiderata by imposing constraints on the lower order moments or other functions of those distributions. We present a unified framework that encompasses methods that can deal with different settings and fairness criteria, and that enjoys strong theoretical guarantees. We introduce an approach to learn fair representations that can generalize to unseen tasks. Finally, we describe a technique that accounts for legal restrictions about the use of sensitive attributes.;,citation_author=Luca Oneto;,citation_author=Silvia Chiappa;,citation_editor=Luca Oneto;,citation_editor=Nicolò Navarin;,citation_editor=Alessandro Sperduti;,citation_editor=Davide Anguita;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1007/978-3-030-43883-8_7;,citation_isbn=978-3-030-43883-8;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_inbook_title=Recent Trends in Learning From Data: Tutorials from the INNS Big Data and Deep Learning Conference (INNSBDDL2019);,citation_series_title=Studies in Computational Intelligence;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An exploratory study of sex and gender differences in demographic, psychosocial, clinical, and substance use treatment characteristics of patients in outpatient opioid use disorder treatment with buprenorphine;,citation_abstract=As treatment expansion in the opioid epidemic continues, it is important to examine how the makeup of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) is evolving. Treatment programs are increasingly utilizing buprenorphine, an effective OUD medication. This exploratory study examines sex and gender differences in psychosocial, clinical, and substance use treatment characteristics of a clinical population in outpatient medication treatment for OUD with buprenorphine. This is a secondary data analysis from a cross-sectional survey study with retrospective medical record review conducted with patients recruited from an office-based opioid treatment clinic between July–September 2019. Participants on buprenorphine for at least 28 days at time of survey completion were included (n = 133). Differences between men and women were explored with Pearson $\chi^2$ and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and T-tests for continuous variables. The sample was 55.6% women and nearly three fourths Black (70.7%). Mean days in current treatment episode was 431.6 (SD = 244.82). Women were younger and more likely to be unemployed, identify as a sexual minority, and live alone with children than men. More women than men had a psychiatric comorbidity. Women reported more prescription opioid misuse while men had more heroin only opioid use. More men reported comorbid alcohol use and a history of drug overdose. One third of participants reported recent discrimination in a health care setting due to substance use. As buprenorphine-based outpatient treatment programs continue to expand, present study findings support evaluation of the unique needs of men and women in order to better tailor OUD-related services and improve treatment outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Randomized clinical trial of an Internet-based versus brief office intervention for adolescent smoking cessation;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of novel treatment delivery methods, such as the Internet are notably absent from the adolescent smoking treatment literature. METHODS: Adolescent smokers ages 11-18 years were randomized to a clinic-based, brief office intervention (BOI; N=69) consisting of four individual counseling sessions; or to Stomp Out Smokes (SOS), an Internet, home-based intervention (N=70). Adolescents in SOS had access to the SOS site for 24 weeks. RESULTS: The 30-day, point-prevalence smoking abstinence rates for BOI and SOS were 12% versus 6% at week 24 and 13% versus 6% at week 36, with no significant treatment differences. Among participants who continued to smoke, SOS was associated with a significantly greater reduction in average number of days smoked than BOI (P=0.006). The BOI was found to be feasible with high session attendance rates. SOS participants accessed the site a mean+/-S.D. of 6.8+/-7.1 days. SOS use dropped to less than one-third of participants by week 3. CONCLUSION: Additional research is needed to tap the potential capabilities of the Internet for adolescent smoking cessation using proactive, personalized, patient-education components.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A current re-examination of racial/ethnic disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment: Do disparities persist?;,citation_abstract=Objective Racial/ethnic disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment services have been documented. The objective of this study was to re-examine if racial/ethnic disparities in the use of treatment still exist using current data collected post-implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Methods Data were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Analyses were limited to adult White, Black, and Latino participants who met DSM-IV criteria for a past-year substance use disorder (n = 12,070). Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models examined the role of race/ethnicity on past-year use of (1) any substance abuse treatment services and (2) specialty treatment. Important covariates included socio-demographics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. A sub-analysis was also conducted that was limited to participants who reported having health insurance to explore the role of insurance status on treatment utilization by race/ethnicity. Results Findings showed that Latinos and Blacks significantly underutilized specialty treatment relative to Whites. These relationships were statistically significant after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. However, when analyses were limited to only those with health insurance, Black-White disparities became non-significant, while Latino-White disparities persisted. Conclusions Findings highlight that Black-White and Latino-White disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment still persist. However, Black-White disparities may be limited to only those who are uninsured.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lapse, Relapse, and Chasing the Wagon: Post-Treatment Drinking and Recovery;,citation_abstract=This study examines relapse and recovery in Project MATCH. The study examines the transitions between periods of abstinence, lapse, and relapse. A set of proximal and distal variables were hypothesized to predict the likelihood of a transition to a different state over time using a semi-Markov model. The distal variables were stable predictors of relapse including severity of addiction, drug use, and psychiatric severity. The proximal predictors, which varied over time, included anger, symptoms of depression, action, struggling with maintenance, temptation, confidence, and social support. The study examined drinking outcomes of 469 individuals post-treatment and found that confidence to abstain and action orientation increased the probability of abstinence, and decreased the probability of lapsed and relapsed drinking. Confidence and endorsing action stage behaviors and attitudes were associated with the abstinence violation effect. The constructs of temptation and struggling with maintenance acted as risk factors for higher levels of drinking. Depression had mixed effects and appeared to be related to lapsed drinking more than relapsed drinking. Alcohol involvement acted as a risk factor for relapsed drinking. Information about the individuals drinking history was also examined. The number of prior episodes in abstinence or drinking states increased the probability of returning to the same types of abstinent or drinking behaviors. The length of each episode less frequently was significantly related to the transitions, However when significant, longer periods of abstinence and relapsed drinking were associated with less likely return to the same behaviors. Of particular note was that a history of relapsed drinking made lapsed drinking less likely, and a history of lapsed drinking made relapsed drinking less likely. This pattern supports the underlying division of drinking behaviors into the two categories of lapse and relapse. This study demonstrated that novel statistical methods such as Semi-Markov models can be used to investigate questions which could not be addressed or effectively answered with more commonly used methods. The semi-Markov models of transitions between drinking states helped to explain the complexity of the road to recovery.;,citation_author=Daniel Brett Rounsaville;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_isbn=9781124454702;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=University of Maryland, Baltimore County;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Voodoo Machine Learning for Clinical Predictions;,citation_abstract=The availability of smartphone and wearable sensor technology is leading to a rapid accumulation of human subject data, and machine learning is emerging as a technique to map that data into clinical predictions. As machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision making, it is important to reliably quantify their prediction accuracy. Cross-validation is the standard approach for evaluating the accuracy of such algorithms; however, several cross-validations methods exist and only some of them are statistically meaningful. Here we compared two popular cross-validation methods: record-wise and subject-wise. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise cross-validation often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also found that this erroneous method is used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes. As we move towards an era of machine learning based diagnosis and treatment, using proper methods to evaluate their accuracy is crucial, as erroneous results can mislead both clinicians and data scientists.;,citation_author=Sohrab Saeb;,citation_author=Luca Lonini;,citation_author=Arun Jayaraman;,citation_author=David C.

In this paper, we propose a time series pattern mining method to detect significant stress episodes in a time series of discontinuous and rapidly varying stress data. We apply our model to 4 weeks of physiological, GPS, and activity data collected from 38 users in their natural environment to discover patterns of stress in real-life. We find that the duration of a prior stress episode predicts the duration of the next stress episode and stress in mornings and evenings is lower than during the day. We then analyze the relationship between stress and objectively rated disorder in the surrounding neighborhood and develop a model to predict stressful episodes.;,citation_author=Hillol Sarker;,citation_author=Matthew Tyburski;,citation_author=Md Mahbubur Rahman;,citation_author=Karen Hovsepian;,citation_author=Moushumi Sharmin;,citation_author=David H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Projected Workforce of Psychiatrists in the United States: A Population Analysis;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: This analysis quantified and assessed the projected workforce of psychiatrists in the United States through 2050 on the basis of population data. METHODS: With use of data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (2000-2015), American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (2000-2015), and U.S. Census Bureau (2000-2050), the psychiatrist workforce was projected through 2050. Two established psychiatrist-to-population ratios were used to determine the estimated demand for psychiatrists and potential shortages. RESULTS: The psychiatrist workforce will contract through 2024 to a projected low of 38,821, which is equal to a shortage of between 14,280 and 31,091 psychiatrists, depending on the psychiatrist-to-population ratio used. A slow expansion will begin in 2025. By 2050, the workforce of psychiatrists will range from a shortage of 17,705 psychiatrists to a surplus of 3,428. CONCLUSIONS: Because of steady population growth and the retirement of more than half the current workforce, the psychiatrist workforce will continue to contract through 2024 if no interventions are implemented, leading to a significant shortage of psychiatrists. Despite an expected workforce expansion beginning in 2025, it is unclear whether the shortage will completely resolve by 2050. Future research should focus on developing strategies to address this quantified shortage in an effort to curb the worsening shortage through 2024 and over the coming decades.;,citation_author=Anand Satiani;,citation_author=Julie Niedermier;,citation_author=Bhagwan Satiani;,citation_author=Dale P.

Its recent inclusion as a diagnostic criterion for substance use disorders in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders appears at a time when craving research is at an all-time high. Craving is thought to predict relapse and may deter individuals from even trying to quit. Researchers have developed experimental craving-induction paradigms to identify factors contributing to craving and to test interventions to alleviate craving. This review offers a critique of laboratory craving studies, with particular emphasis on cigarette craving. It raises questions concerning several conceptual and methodological assumptions underlying this research, identifies processes that may explain why cravings are linked to drug use and relapse, addresses contextual factors that may influence various experiences of craving, and considers recent interventions targeting craving. The relation between craving and both emotion and coping is discussed, as well as the level of insight that individuals have about their own future cravings.;,citation_author=Michael A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ethnic disparities in clinical severity and services for alcohol problems: Results from the National Alcohol Survey;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: This study reports lifetime estimates of the extent of unmet need for alcohol services across the 3 largest ethnic groups in America, and examines factors that may contribute to ethnic differences in service use. Prior studies report mixed findings as to the existence of ethnic disparities in alcohol services, with some suggesting that minorities are over-represented in treatment settings. METHODS: Drawing on the most recent National Alcohol Surveys, we compare rates and factors associated with the lifetime service use for alcohol problems among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics who meet lifetime criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. RESULTS: While bivariate analyses revealed few ethnic differences in service use, there were significant differences by ethnicity in multivariate models that included alcohol problem severity and its interactions with ethnicity. At higher levels of problem severity, both Hispanics and Blacks were less likely to have utilized services than comparable Whites. Hispanics, on the whole, reported higher-severity alcohol problems than Whites. Yet, they were less likely to have received specialty treatment and multiple types of alcohol services, and were more likely to cite economic and logistical barriers as reasons for not obtaining care. CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts to study ethnic disparities in alcohol services should utilize analytic approaches that address potential confounding between ethnicity and other factors in service use, such as alcohol problem severity. Our findings suggest that Hispanics and Blacks with higher-severity alcohol problems may utilize services at lower rates than comparable Whites, and that, particularly for Hispanics, this may in part be attributable to financial and logistical barriers to care.;,citation_author=Laura A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Just-in-time adaptive ecological momentary assessment (JITA-EMA);,citation_abstract=Interest in just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) has rapidly increased in recent years. One core challenge for JITAI is the efficient and precise measurement of tailoring variables that are used to inform the timing of momentary intervention delivery. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is often used for this purpose, even though EMA in its traditional form was not designed specifically to facilitate momentary interventions. In this article, we introduce just-in-time adaptive EMA (JITA-EMA) as a strategy to reduce participant response burden and decrease measurement error when EMA is used as a tailoring variable in JITAI. JITA-EMA builds on computerized adaptive testing methods developed for purposes of classification (computerized classification testing, CCT), and applies them to the classification of momentary states within individuals. The goal of JITA-EMA is to administer a small and informative selection of EMA questions needed to accurately classify an individual’s current state at each measurement occasion. After illustrating the basic components of JITA-EMA (adaptively choosing the initial and subsequent items to administer, adaptively stopping item administration, accommodating dynamically tailored classification cutoffs), we present two simulation studies that explored the performance of JITA-EMA, using the example of momentary fatigue states. Compared with conventional EMA item selection methods that administered a fixed set of questions at each moment, JITA-EMA yielded more accurate momentary classification with fewer questions administered. Our results suggest that JITA-EMA has the potential to enhance some approaches to mobile health interventions by facilitating efficient and precise identification of momentary states that may inform intervention tailoring.;,citation_author=Stefan Schneider;,citation_author=Doerte U.

Common EMA designs combine event-based reports of substance use with time-based assessments. Approaches to data organization and analysis have been very diverse, particularly regarding their treatment of time. Compliance with signaled assessments is often high. Compliance with recording of substance use appears good, but is harder to validate. Treatment applications of EMA are emerging.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Quantifying alcohol consumption: Self-report, transdermal assessment, and prediction of dependence symptoms;,citation_abstract=Research on alcohol use depends heavily on the validity of self-reported drinking. The present paper presents data from 647 days of self-monitoring with a transdermal alcohol sensor by 60 young adults. We utilized a bio chemical measure, transdermal alcohol assessment with the WrisTAS, to examine the convergent validity of three approaches to collecting daily self-report drinking data: experience sampling, daily morning reports of the previous night, and 1-week timeline follow-back (TLFB) assessments. We tested associations between three pharmacokinetic indices (peak concentration, area under the curve (AUC), and time to reach peak concentration) derived from the transdermal alcohol signal and within- and between-person variation in alcohol dependence symptoms. The WrisTAS data corroborated 85.74% of self-reported drinking days based on the experience sampling data. The TLFB assessment and combined experience sampling and morning reports agreed on 87.27% of drinking days. Drinks per drinking day did not vary as a function of wearing or not wearing the sensor; this indicates that participants provided consistent reports of their drinking regardless of biochemical verification. In respect to self-reported alcohol dependence symptoms, the AUC of the WrisTAS alcohol signal was associated with dependence symptoms at both the within- and between-person level. Furthermore, alcohol dependence symptoms at baseline predicted drinking episodes characterized in biochemical data by both higher peak alcohol concentration and faster time to reach peak concentration. The results support the validity of self-report alcohol data, provide empirical data useful for optimal design of daily process sampling, and provide an initial demon stration of the use of transdermal alcohol assessment to characterize drinking dynamics associated with risk for alcohol dependence.;,citation_author=Jeffrey S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Variety in Alcohol Use Disorder Relapse Definitions: Should the Term “Relapse” Be Abandoned?;,citation_abstract=Objective: The definition of relapse has been the subject of debate for decades, and a semantic ambiguity highlighted in a 2016 article in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs remains. The current article replicates and extends the 2016 findings on alcohol use disorder (AUD) relapse definitions. Method: We conducted a systematic review of 321 articles that examined relapse in patients with AUD, published from 2000 to 2019. Relapse definitions were extracted and a narrative review of definitions was conducted. Results: One hundred and one different definitions of relapse were used in 251 (78%) of the reviewed articles. In 70 (22%) of articles, no definition of AUD relapse was provided. Fifty-three articles used diagnostic criteria (i.e., alcohol use after remission of AUD), whereas 99 articles defined relapse as “any alcohol use” or “any use of alcohol/drugs.” Additional articles defined relapse by alcohol outcomes (e.g., percent drinking days), alcohol-related problems, or hospitalizations (n = 97). Only 12 articles described the time window of abstinence preceding a relapse. We observed relatively no meaningful intercontinental or time-related differences in relapse definitions, although the outcome “percent heavy drinking days” was used more frequently in recent studies. Conclusions: A wide variety of relapse definitions were identified. Despite decades of research and discussion, there is still no widely accepted consensus definition of AUD relapse. We propose to shift the focus toward clinical continuous outcomes, course specifiers based on the number of AUD symptoms present, and quality-of-life–related criteria instead of using current dichotomous AUD relapse terminology.;,citation_author=Wilco Sliedrecht;,citation_author=Hendrik Roozen;,citation_author=Ranne Waart;,citation_author=Geert Dom;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_publication_date=2022-03;,citation_cover_date=2022-03;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.15288/jsad.2022.83.248;,citation_issn=1937-1888;,citation_volume=83;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs;,citation_publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation, Inc.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pooled and person-specific machine learning models for predicting future alcohol consumption, craving, and wanting to drink: A demonstration of parallel utility;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The specific factors driving alcohol consumption, craving, and wanting to drink, are likely different for different people. The present study sought to apply statistical classification methods to idiographic time series data in order to identify person-specific predictors of future drinking-relevant behavior, affect, and cognitions in a college student sample. DESIGN: Participants were sent 8 mobile phone surveys per day for 15 days. Each survey assessed the number of drinks consumed since the previous survey, as well as positive affect, negative affect, alcohol craving, drinking expectancies, perceived alcohol consumption norms, impulsivity, and social and situational context. Each individual’s data were split into training and testing sets, so that trained models could be validated using person-specific out-of-sample data. Elastic net regularization was used to select a subset of a set of 40 variables to be used to predict either alcohol consumption, craving, or wanting to drink, forward in time. SETTING: A west-coast university. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three university students who had consumed alcohol in their lifetime. MEASUREMENTS: Mobile phone surveys. FINDINGS: Averaging across participants, accurate out-of-sample predictions of future drinking were made 76% of the time. For craving, the mean out-of-sample R$^2$ value was .27. For wanting to drink, the mean out-of-sample R$^2$ value was .27. CONCLUSION: Using a person-specific constellation of psychosocial and temporal variables, it may be possible to accurately predict drinking behavior, affect, and cognitions before they occur.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Targeting the Barriers in the Substance Use Disorder Continuum of Care With Peer Recovery Support;,citation_abstract=Substance Use Disorder (SUD) has been recognized as a chronic, relapsing disorder. However, much of existing SUD care remains based in an acute care model that focuses on clinical stabilization and discharge, failing to address the longer-term needs of people in recovery from addiction. The high rates of client’s disengagement and attrition across the continuum of care highlight the need to identify and overcome the obstacles that people face at each stage of the treatment and recovery process. Peer recovery support services (PRSS) show promise in helping people initiate, pursue, and sustain long-term recovery from substance-related problems. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, the goal of this article is to explore the possible roles of peers along the SUD care continuum and their potential to improve engagement in care by targeting specific barriers that prevent people from successfully transitioning from one stage to the next leading eventually to full recovery. A multidimensional framework of SUD care continuum was developed based on the adapted model of opioid use disorder cascade of care and recovery stages, within which the barriers known to be associated with each stage of the continuum were matched with the existing evidence of effectiveness of specific PRSSs. With this conceptual paper, we are hoping to show how PRSSs can become a complementary and integrated part of the system of care, which is an essential step toward improving the continuity of care and health outcomes.;,citation_author=Milena Stanojlović;,citation_author=Larry Davidson;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1177/1178221820976988;,citation_issn=1178-2218;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd STM;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Time-varying effect modeling with intensive longitudinal data: Examining dynamic links among craving, affect, self-efficacy and substance use during addiction recovery;,citation_abstract=Time-varying effect modeling (TVEM), a statistical technique for modeling dynamic patterns of change, presents new opportunities to study biobehavioral health processes. TVEM is particularly useful when applied to intensive longitudinal data (ILD) because it permits highly flexible modeling of outcomes over continuous time, as well as of associations between variables and moderation effects. TVEM coupled with ILD is ideal for the study of addiction. This article provides a general overview of using TVEM, particularly when applied to ILD, to better enable addiction scientists to conduct novel analyses that are important to realizing the dynamics of addiction-related processes. It presents an empirical example using ecological momentary assessment data from participants throughout their first 90 days of addiction recovery to estimate the (1) associations between morning craving and same-day recovery outcomes, (2) association between morning positive and negative affect and same-day recovery outcomes and (3) time-varying moderation effects of affect on the association between morning craving and recovery outcomes. We provide a didactic overview in implementing and interpreting the aims and results, including equations, computer syntax and reference resources. Our results highlight how affect operates as both a time-varying risk and protective factor on recovery outcomes, particularly when considered in combination with experiences of craving (i.e. dynamic moderation). We conclude by discussing our results, recent innovations and future directions of TVEM for advancing addiction science, including how “time” can be operationalized to probe new research questions.;,citation_author=Samuel W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health;,citation_abstract=This Surgeon General’s Report has been created because of the important health and social problems associated with alcohol and drug misuse in America. As described in this Report, a comprehensive approach is needed to address substance use problems in the United States that includes several key components: Enhanced public education to improve awareness about substance use problems and demand for more effective policies and practices to address them; Widespread implementation of evidence-based prevention policies and programs to prevent substance misuse and related harms; Improved access to evidence-based treatment services, integrated with mainstream health care, for those at risk for or affected by substance use disorders; Recovery support services (RSS) to assist individuals in maintaining remission and preventing relapse; and Research-informed public policies and financing strategies to ensure that substance misuse and use disorder services are accessible, compassionate, efficient, and sustainable. Recognizing these needs, the Report explains the neurobiological basis for substance use disorders and provides the biological, psychological, and social frameworks for improving diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of alcohol and drug misuse. It also describes evidence-based prevention strategies, such as public policies that can reduce substance misuse problems (e.g., driving under the influence [DUI]); effective treatment strategies, including medications and behavioral therapies for treating substance use disorders; and RSS for people who have completed treatment. Additionally, the Report describes recent changes in health care financing, including changes in health insurance regulations, which support the integration of clinical prevention and treatment services for substance use disorders into mainstream health care practice, and defines a research agenda for addressing alcohol and drug misuse as medical conditions. Thus, this first Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health is not issued simply because of the prevalence of substance misuse or even the related devastating harms and costs, but also to help inform policymakers, health care professionals, and the general public about effective, practical, and sustainable strategies to address these problems. These strategies have the potential to substantially reduce substance misuse and related problems; promote early intervention for substance misuse and substance use disorders; and improve the availability of high-quality treatment and RSS for persons with substance use disorders.;,citation_author=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (US);,citation_author=Office of the Surgeon General (US);,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_pmid=28252892;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_series_title=Reports of the Surgeon General;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using Elastic Net Penalized Cox Proportional Hazards Regression to Identify Predictors of Imminent Smoking Lapse;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Machine learning algorithms such as elastic net regression and backward selection provide a unique and powerful approach to model building given a set of psychosocial predictors of smoking lapse measured repeatedly via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Understanding these predictors may aid in developing interventions for smoking lapse prevention. METHODS: In a randomized-controlled smoking cessation trial, smartphone-based EMAs were collected from 92 participants following a scheduled quit date. This secondary analysis utilized elastic net-penalized cox proportional hazards regression and model approximation via backward elimination to (1) optimize a predictive model of time to first lapse and (2) simplify that model to its core constituent predictors to maximize parsimony and generalizability. RESULTS: Elastic net proportional hazards regression selected 17 of 26 possible predictors from 2065 EMAs to model time to first lapse. The predictors with the highest magnitude regression coefficients were having consumed alcohol in the past hour, being around and interacting with a smoker, and having cigarettes easily available. This model was reduced using backward elimination, retaining five predictors and approximating to 93.9% of model fit. The retained predictors included those mentioned above as well as feeling irritable and being in areas where smoking is either discouraged or allowed (as opposed to not permitted). CONCLUSIONS: The strongest predictors of smoking lapse were environmental in nature (e.g., being in smoking-permitted areas) as opposed to internal factors such as psychological affect. Interventions may be improved by a renewed focus of interventions on these predictors. IMPLICATIONS: The present study demonstrated the utility of machine learning algorithms to optimize the prediction of time to smoking lapse using EMA data. The two models generated by the present analysis found that environmental factors were most strongly related to smoking lapse. The results support the use of machine learning algorithms to investigate intensive longitudinal data, and provide a foundation for the development of highly tailored, just-in-time interventions that can target on multiple antecedents of smoking lapse.;,citation_author=Robert Suchting;,citation_author=Emily T.

Despite this, treatment models focus on acute interventions and are carved out from the main health care system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) brings the opportunity to change the way substance use disorder (SUD) is treated in the United States. The treatment of SUD must adapt to a chronic care model offered in an integrated care system that screens for at-risk patients and includes services needed to prevent relapses. The partnering of the health care system with substance abuse treatment programs could dramatically expand the benefits of prevention and treatment of SUD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The risk assessment of relapse among newly enrolled participants in methadone maintenance treatment: A group-LASSO based Bayesian network study;,citation_abstract=BackgroundRelapse is a great barrier to improving the effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Participants with different treatment durations could vary in their compliance with MMT, which may lead to different levels of relapse risk. This study aims to identify the risk factors for relapse and assess the relapse risk of MMT participants of different treatment durations.MethodThis retrospective study used data collected from seven MMT clinics in Guangdong Province, China, from January 2010 to April 2017. Newly enrolled participants who received 6 (n = 903) and 12 (n = 710) months of consecutive treatment with complete data were included. We selected significant risk factors for relapse through the group lasso regression and then incorporated them into Bayesian networks to reveal relationships between factors and predict the relapse risk.ResultsThe results showed that participants who received 6-month treatment had a lower relapse rate (32.0%) than those of 12-month treatment (39.0%, P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05). Factors including personal living status and daily methadone dose were only influential to those who received the 6-month treatment. However, age, age at the initial drug use, HIV infection status, sexual behaviors, and continuous treatment days were common factors of both durations. The highest relapse risk for those after the 6-month treatment was inferred as 66.7% while that of the 12-month treatment was 83.3%. Farmers and those who have high accessibility to MMT services may require additional attention.ConclusionIt is necessary to implement targeted interventions and education based on the treatment durations of participants to decrease the relapse rate.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stigma among health professionals towards patients with substance use disorders and its consequences for healthcare delivery: Systematic review;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals are crucial in the identification and accessibility to treatment for people with substance use disorders. Our objective was to assess health professionals’ attitudes towards patients with substance use disorders and examine the consequences of these attitudes on healthcare delivery for these patients in Western countries. METHODS: Pubmed, PsycINFO and Embase were systematically searched for articles published between 2000 and 2011. Studies evaluating health professionals’ attitudes towards patients with substance use disorders and consequences of negative attitudes were included. An inclusion criterion was that studies addressed alcohol or illicit drug abuse. Reviews, commentaries and letters were excluded, as were studies originating from non-Western countries. RESULTS: The search process yielded 1562 citations. After selection and quality assessment, 28 studies were included. Health professionals generally had a negative attitude towards patients with substance use disorders. They perceived violence, manipulation, and poor motivation as impeding factors in the healthcare delivery for these patients. Health professionals also lacked adequate education, training and support structures in working with this patient group. Negative attitudes of health professionals diminished patients’ feelings of empowerment and subsequent treatment outcomes. Health professionals are less involved and have a more task-oriented approach in the delivery of healthcare, resulting in less personal engagement and diminished empathy. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that negative attitudes of health professionals towards patients with substance use disorders are common and contribute to suboptimal health care for these patients. However, few studies have evaluated the consequences of health professionals’ negative attitudes towards patients with substance use disorders.;,citation_author=Leonieke C.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is one of the single most expensive disorders in the United States, generating average medical costs of $60B from just 2&nbsp;million Americans diagnosed with the disorder. In commercial use since 2019, reSET-O is a non-drug, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) that delivers evidence-based neurobehavioral treatment for OUD and helps overcome the barriers associated with access to care, stigma, and social distancing.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stigmatizing attitudes of primary care professionals towards people with mental disorders: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=Objective To examine stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders among primary care professionals and to identify potential factors related to stigmatizing attitudes through a systematic review. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, Lilacs, IBECS, Index Psicologia, CUMED, MedCarib, Sec. Est. Saúde SP, WHOLIS, Hanseníase, LIS-Localizador de Informação em Saúde, PAHO, CVSO-Regional, and Latindex, through the Virtual Health Library portal ( http://www.bireme.br website) through to June 2017. The articles included in the review were summarized through a narrative synthesis. Results After applying eligibility criteria, 11 articles, out of 19.109 references identified, were included in the review. Primary care physicians do present stigmatizing attitudes towards patients with mental disorders and show more negative attitudes towards patients with schizophrenia than towards those with depression. Older and more experience doctors have more stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness compared with younger and less-experienced doctors. Health-care providers who endorse more stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness were likely to be more pessimistic about the patient’s adherence to treatment. Conclusions Stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders are common among physicians in primary care settings, particularly among older and more experienced doctors. Stigmatizing attitudes can act as an important barrier for patients to receive the treatment they need. The primary care physicians feel they need better preparation, training, and information to deal with and to treat mental illness, such as a user friendly and pragmatic classification system that addresses the high prevalence of mental disorders in primary care and community settings.;,citation_author=Angel O.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using machine learning to identify predictors of imminent drinking and create tailored messages for at-risk drinkers experiencing homelessness;,citation_abstract=Adults experiencing homelessness are more likely to have an alcohol use disorder compared to adults in the general population. Although shelter-based treatments are common, completion rates tend to be poor, suggesting a need for more effective approaches that are tailored to this understudied and underserved population. One barrier to developing more effective treatments is the limited knowledge of the triggers of alcohol use among homeless adults. This paper describes the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify predictors of “imminent drinking” (i.e., drinking within the next 4&nbsp;h), among a sample of adults experiencing homelessness and receiving health services at a homeless shelter. A total of 78 mostly male (84.6%) adults experiencing homelessness (mean age&nbsp;=&nbsp;46.6) who reported hazardous drinking completed up to five EMAs per day over 4&nbsp;weeks (a total of 4557 completed EMAs). The study used machine learning techniques to create a drinking risk algorithm that predicted 82% of imminent drinking episodes within 4&nbsp;h of the first drink of the day, and correctly identified 76% of nondrinking episodes. The algorithm included the following 7 predictors of imminent drinking: urge to drink, having alcohol easily available, feeling confident that alcohol would improve mood, feeling depressed, lower commitment to being alcohol free, not interacting with someone drinking alcohol, and being indoors. The research team used the results to develop intervention content (e.g., brief tailored messages) that will be delivered when imminent drinking is detected in an upcoming intervention phase. Specifically, we created three theoretically grounded message tracks focused on urge/craving, social/availability, and negative affect/mood, which are further tailored to a participant’s current drinking goal (i.e., stay sober, drink less, no goal) to support positive change. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop tailored intervention messages based on likelihood of imminent drinking, current drinking triggers, and drinking goals among adults experiencing homelessness.;,citation_author=Scott T.

This study examined the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of reSET-O in conjunction with treatment as usual (reSET-O + TAU) relative to TAU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with $\geq$1 OUD diagnosis, treated with buprenorphine from 1 January 2015 to 30 March 2018, were identified from Truven Health MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Research Databases. Twelve-week healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) costs for patients categorized as adherent and nonadherent to buprenorphine treatment were estimated. Total 12-week costs included OUD treatment and other HCRU costs. The cost-effectiveness of reSET-O + TAU was modeled in accordance with prior clinical trial outcomes. The 12-week budget impact of reSET-O was modeled for a 1 million-member healthcare plan. RESULTS: Higher buprenorphine adherence was associated with lower HCRU costs in claims data. Twelve-week per-patient total costs were $305 more for those receiving reSET-O + TAU than those receiving TAU. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $18.70 per 1 percentage-point increase in the treatment retention rate. The probability that reSET-O + TAU would be considered cost-effective was over 92% for willingness-to-pay thresholds of $6,000 or more. The 12-week budget impact of reSET-O was $8,908, translating to $0.003 per member per month. LIMITATIONS: The findings of the cost-effectiveness and budget impact modeling are limited by the assumptions of the models due to uncertainty around some inputs. While no model is free of bias, the inputs for this model were carefully selected to reflect contemporary treatment patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the payer’s willingness to pay, reSET-O may be cost-effective in increasing buprenorphine treatment retention rates. reSET-O results in an approximate budget impact of $0.003 per member per month, depending on market share and the prevalence of the population receiving treatment for OUD.;,citation_author=Weijia Wang;,citation_author=Nicole Gellings Lowe;,citation_author=Ali Jalali;,citation_author=Sean M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Failure and delay in initial treatment contact after first onset of mental disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication;,citation_abstract=CONTEXT: An understudied crucial step in the help-seeking process is making prompt initial contact with a treatment provider after first onset of a mental disorder. OBJECTIVE: To provide data on patterns and predictors of failure and delay in making initial treatment contact after first onset of a mental disorder in the United States from the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication. DESIGN AND SETTING: Nationally representative face-to-face household survey carried out between February 2001 and April 2003. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9282 respondents aged 18 years and older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime DSM-IV disorders were assessed with the World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), a fully structured interview designed to be administered by trained lay interviewers. Information about age of first professional treatment contact for each lifetime DSM-IV/WMH-CIDI disorder assessed in the survey was collected and compared with age at onset of the disorder to study typical duration of delay. RESULTS: Cumulative lifetime probability curves show that the vast majority of people with lifetime disorders eventually make treatment contact, although more so for mood (88.1%-94.2%) disorders than for anxiety (27.3%-95.3%), impulse control (33.9%-51.8%), or substance (52.7%-76.9%) disorders. Delay among those who eventually make treatment contact ranges from 6 to 8 years for mood disorders and 9 to 23 years for anxiety disorders. Failure to make initial treatment contact and delay among those who eventually make treatment contact are both associated with early age of onset, being in an older cohort, and a number of socio-demographic characteristics (male, married, poorly educated, racial/ethnic minority). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to make prompt initial treatment contact is a pervasive aspect of unmet need for mental health care in the United States. Interventions to speed initial treatment contact are likely to reduce the burdens and hazards of untreated mental disorder.;,citation_author=Philip S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Just-in-the-Moment Adaptive Interventions (JITAI): A Meta-Analytical Review;,citation_abstract=A just-in-time, adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an emerging type of intervention that provides tailored support at the exact time of need. It does so using enabling new technologies (e.g., mobile phones, sensors) that capture the changing states of individuals. Extracting effect sizes of primary outcomes produced by 33 empirical studies that used JITAIs, we found moderate to large effect sizes of JITAI treatments compared to (1) waitlist-control conditions (k&nbsp;=&nbsp;9), Hedges’s g =&nbsp;1.65 and (2) non-JITAI treatments (k&nbsp;=&nbsp;21), g =&nbsp;0.89.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A day-by-day prospective analysis of stress, craving and risk of next day alcohol intake during alcohol use disorder treatment;,citation_abstract=Background Stress has been known to increase craving in individuals with Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) and predict future alcohol relapse risk, but whether stress on a particular day affects craving on that day to impact prospective alcohol intake in the real world, particularly during early treatment and recovery, has not been studied thus far. Method The first study included 85 AUD individuals who reported their daily stress, craving, and alcohol intake in the first two weeks of early treatment. A second validation study included 28 AUD patients monitored daily during eight weeks of outpatient 12-Step based behavioral counseling treatment for AUD. Data were collected from telephone-based daily diaries for 903 days in Study 1 and 1488 in Study 2. Multilevel latent models tested if daily and person-averaged craving mediated the link between stressful events and next day drinking during treatment. Results In both Study 1 and 2, exposure to a stressful event on a particular day predicted increased craving on that day (p’s$\leq$.002); and such increases in craving predicted the likelihood of drinking the next day (p’s$\leq$.014) and the drinking amount (p’s$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ = 008). Individuals who experienced more stressful events reported higher craving (p’s$\leq$.012), and higher cravers reported greater next day drinking (p’s$&amp;lt;$.001). Conclusions The results across two studies with separate samples are the first to establish that craving directly mediates the association between stress and next day alcohol intake in individuals with AUD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does distance affect utilization of substance abuse and mental health services in the presence of transportation services?;,citation_abstract=Long travel times have been identified as a significant barrier to accessing mental health and other critical services. This study examines whether distance to treatment was a barrier to receiving outpatient mental health and substance abuse care for HIV-positive persons when transportation was provided. Data from a cohort of HIV-positive persons who participated in a year-long substance abuse and mental health treatment programme were examined longitudinally. Transportation, which included buses, taxis, and mileage reimbursement for private transportation, was provided free of charge for participants who needed this assistance. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of participants utilized the transportation services. No statistically significant differences in retention in, or utilization of, the mental health and substance abuse treatment programme were identified by distance to the treatment site. This analysis demonstrated that increased distance to care did not decrease utilization of the treatment programme when transportation was provided to the client when necessary. These results provide preliminary evidence that distance to substance abuse and mental health services need not be a barrier to care for HIV-positive individuals when transportation is provided. Such options may need to be considered when trying to treat geographically dispersed individuals so that efficiencies in treatment can be attained.;,citation_author=R. Whetten;,citation_author=K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST): Development, reliability and feasibility;,citation_abstract=AIMS: The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was developed for the World Health Organization (WHO) by an international group of substance abuse researchers to detect psychoactive substance use and related problems in primary care patients. This report describes the new instrument as well as a study of its reliability and feasibility. SETTING: The study was conducted at participating sites in Australia, Brazil, Ireland, India, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe. Sixty per cent of the sample was recruited from alcohol and drug abuse treatment facilities; the remainder was drawn from general medical settings and psychiatric facilities. METHODS: The study was concerned primarily with test item reliability, using a simple test-retest procedure to determine whether subjects would respond consistently to the same items when presented in an interview format on two different occasions. Qualitative and quantitative data were also collected to evaluate the feasibility of the screening items and rating format. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 236 volunteer participants completed test and retest interviews at nine collaborating sites. Slightly over half of the sample (53.6%) was male. The mean age of the sample was 34 years and they had completed, on average, 10 years of education. RESULTS: The average test-retest reliability coefficients (kappas) ranged from a high of 0.90 (consistency of reporting ’ever’ use of substance) to a low of 0.58 (regretted what was done under influence of substance). The average kappas for substance classes ranged from 0.61 for sedatives to 0.78 for opioids. In general, the reliabilities were in the range of good to excellent, with the following items demonstrating the highest kappas across all drug classes: use in the last 3 months, preoccupied with drug use, concern expressed by others, troubled by problems related to drug use, intravenous drug use. Qualitative data collected at the end of the retest interview suggested that the questions were not difficult to answer and were consistent with patients’ expectations for a health interview. The data were used to guide the selection of a smaller set of items that can serve as the basis for more extensive validation research. CONCLUSION: The ASSIST items are reliable and feasible to use as part of an international screening test. Further evaluation of the screening test should be conducted.;,citation_author=WHO ASSIST Working Group;,citation_publication_date=2002-09;,citation_cover_date=2002-09;,citation_year=2002;,citation_issue=9;,citation_issn=0965-2140;,citation_pmid=12199834;,citation_volume=97;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Addiction (Abingdon, England);">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Health Insurance Trends and Access to Behavioral Healthcare Among Justice-Involved Individuals-United States, 2008-2014;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: A large proportion of justice-involved individuals have mental health issues and substance use disorders (SUD) that are often untreated due to high rates of uninsurance. However, roughly half of justice-involved individuals were estimated to be newly eligible for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess health insurance trends among justice-involved individuals before and after implementation of the ACA’s key provisions, the dependent coverage mandate and Medicaid expansion, and to examine the relationship between health insurance and treatment for behavioral health conditions. DESIGN: Repeated and pooled cross-sectional analyses of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of 15,899 adults age 19-64 years between 2008 and 2014 with a history of justice involvement during the prior 12&nbsp;months. MAIN MEASURES: Uninsurance rates between 2008 and 2014 are reported. Additional outcomes include adjusted treatment rates for depression, serious mental illness, and SUD by insurance status. KEY RESULTS: The dependent coverage mandate was associated with a 13.0 percentage point decline in uninsurance among justice-involved individuals age 19-25 years (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). Following Medicaid expansion, uninsurance declined among justice involved individuals of all ages by 9.7 percentage points (p $&amp;lt;$ 0.001), but remained 16.3 percentage points higher than uninsurance rates for individuals without justice involvement (p $<$ 0.001). In pooled analyses, Medicaid, relative to uninsurance and private insurance, was associated with significantly higher treatment rates for illicit drug abuse/dependence and depression. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of mental illness and substance use disorders among justice-involved populations, persistently elevated rates of uninsurance and other barriers to care remain a significant public health concern. Sustained outreach is required to reduce health insurance disparities between individuals with and without justice involvement. Public insurance appears to be associated with higher treatment rates, relative to uninsurance and private insurance, among justice-involved individuals.;,citation_author=Tyler N. A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling the complexity of post-treatment drinking: It’s a rocky road to relapse;,citation_abstract=The most widely cited road block to successful treatment outcomes for psychological and substance use disorders has been described as the return to the previous behavior, or “relapse.” The operational definition of “relapse” varies from study to study and between clinicians, but in general the term is used to indicate the return to previous levels of symptomatic behavior. One explanation for the variation in the operationalization of relapse is the wide variety of behaviors for which the term is applied, including (but not limited to): depression, substance abuse, schizophrenia, mania, sexual offending, risky sexual behavior, dieting, and the anxiety disorders. A second explanation for the multitude of definitions for relapse is the inherent complexity in the process of behavior change. In this paper we present the most recent treatment outcome research evaluating relapse rates, with a special focus on the substance use disorders. Following this review of the literature we present an argument for the operationalization of relapse as a dynamic process, which can be empirically characterized using dynamical systems theory. We support this argument by presenting results from the analysis of alcohol treatment outcomes using catastrophe modeling techniques. These results demonstrate the utility of catastrophe theory in modeling the alcohol relapse process. The implications of these analyses for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, as well as a discussion of future research incorporating nonlinear dynamical systems theory is provided.;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_author=G.

One hypothesis is that lapses are unpredictable, but another possibility is the complexity of the relapse process is not captured by traditional statistical methods. Data from Project Matching Alcohol Treatments to Client Heterogeneity (Project MATCH), a multisite alcohol treatment study, were reanalyzed with 2 statistical methodologies: catastrophe and 2-part growth mixture modeling. Drawing on previous investigations of self-efficacy as a dynamic predictor of relapse, the current study revisits the self-efficacy matching hypothesis, which was not statistically supported in Project MATCH. Results from both the catastrophe and growth mixture analyses demonstrated a dynamic relationship between self-efficacy and drinking outcomes. The growth mixture analyses provided evidence in support of the original matching hypothesis: Individuals with lower self-efficacy who received cognitive behavior therapy drank far less frequently than did those with low self-efficacy who received motivational therapy. These results highlight the dynamical nature of the relapse process and the importance of the use of methodologies that accommodate this complexity when evaluating treatment outcomes.;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_author=Han L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment utilization among persons with opioid use disorder in the United States;,citation_abstract=Background The United States is experiencing an opioid overdose epidemic. Treatment use data from diverse racial/ethnic groups with opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed to inform treatment expansion efforts. Methods We examined demographic characteristics and behavioral health of persons aged $\geq$12 years that met criteria for past-year OUD (n=6,125) in the 2005–2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (N=503,101). We determined the prevalence and correlates of past-year use of alcohol/drug use treatment and opioid-specific treatment to inform efforts for improving OUD treatment. Results Among persons with OUD, 81.93% had prescription (Rx) OUD only, 9.75% had heroin use disorder (HUD) only, and 8.32% had Rx OUD+HUD. Persons with Rx OUD+HUD tended to be white, adults aged 18–49, males, or uninsured. The majority (80.09%) of persons with OUD had another substance use disorder (SUD), and major depressive episode (MDE) was common (28.74%). Of persons with OUD, 26.19% used any alcohol or drug use treatment, and 19.44% used opioid-specific treatment. Adolescents, the uninsured, blacks, native-Hawaiians/Pacific-Islanders/Asian-Americans, persons with Rx OUD only, and persons without MDE or SUD particularly underutilized opioid-specific treatment. Among alcohol/drug use treatment users, self-help group and outpatient rehabilitation treatment were commonly used services. Conclusions Most people with OUD report no use of OUD treatment. Multifaceted interventions, including efforts to access insurance coverage, are required to change attitudes and knowledge towards addiction treatment in order to develop a supportive culture and infrastructure to enable treatment-seeking.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptability of Personal Sensing Among People With Alcohol Use Disorder: Observational Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87% White and n=150, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants’ choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P&amp;amp;amp;lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04).

Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves (auROCs) of .90, .91, and .94 in the 30 held-out test sets for week, day, and hour level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week, day, and hour level models (i.e., past use, future efficacy). However, most of the more punctuate, time varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have greater impact within the next hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk. General scientific summary: This study suggests that densely sampled self-report data can be used to predict lapses back to alcohol use with varying degrees of temporal precision. Additionally, the contextual features contributing to risk of lapse may offer important insight for treatment matching through a digital therapeutic.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Sarah June Kittleson Sant’Ana;,citation_author=Gaylen Fronk;,citation_author=John J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effectiveness of Mindfulness-based Relapse Prevention on Quality of Life and Craving in Methadone-treated Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial;,citation_abstract=Background Quality of life (QOL) is always considered as a final consequence of clinical trials, interventions, and health care. The results of studies indicate that addiction leads to lower QOL. However, studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on improving QOL. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) on QOL and craving in methadone-treated patients. Methods This study was conducted in Qom, Iran, in 2017. A sample of 70 methadone-treated patients were randomly selected and assigned to two groups (intervention and control). Participants in both groups completed the 36-item Short Form (SF-36) QOL Questionnaire and Craving Beliefs Questionnaire (CBQ) at the beginning of the study (pre-test), 8 weeks after the study (post-test), and two months after the study (follow up). In this study, the experimental group received 8 training sessions on mindfulness prevention, while the control group did not receive general information about addiction and did not receive any psychological intervention. Finally, data of 63 patients were analyzed with the SPSS software, chi-square test, t-test, and repeated-measures ANOVA. Findings The results of repeated-measures ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in the pre-test, but MBRP in the intervention group significantly increased the scores of QOL and decreased the scores of craving, significantly (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). Conclusion The findings of present study indicate that MBRP training can increase the psychological and physical health in dependent methadone-treated patients and decrease craving. These findings suggest that mindfulness training can be used as an effective intervention for improving QOL and reducing craving.;,citation_author=Mehdi Yaghubi;,citation_author=Fatemeh Zargar;,citation_publication_date=2018-10;,citation_cover_date=2018-10;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.22122/ahj.v10i4.573;,citation_issn=2008-4633;,citation_pmid=31263524;,citation_volume=10;,citation_journal_title=Addiction &amp;amp; Health;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=If we build it, will they come? Issues of engagement with digital health interventions for trauma recovery;,citation_abstract=Exposure to traumatic events is extremely common with nearly 75% reported to have experienced one or more traumatic events worldwide. A significant number of those exposed will develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) along with depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Globally, trauma-related mental health disorders are the leading cause of global disability burden, and many of these disorders are caused, or worsened, by exposure to wars, natural and human-caused disasters, and other traumatic events. Significant barriers to treatment exist including logistical, geographical, financial, stigma, and other attitudinal challenges. One opportune approach to overcoming these barriers is the provision of mental health interventions via technology that can be readily standardized for wide dissemination of evidence-based care. However, engagement with technology-based interventions is a concern and limited participation and high attrition rates are common. This may be especially true for trauma survivors who often experience symptoms of avoidance and hyperarousal. Engagement is regarded as an essential component of intervention efficacy and has been demonstrated to be associated with more positive clinical outcomes, yet theoretically based research in this area is sparse. This review focuses on the complex issue of engagement with digital health interventions (DHIs). Specifically, we review the conceptualization and measurement of engagement, predictors of engagement, and importantly, the relationship of engagement with intervention effectiveness. Finally, a theoretically based model of engagement is proposed that considers the unique challenges of trauma recovery. This review is not intended to provide a systematic or exhaustive set of recommendations, rather it is intended to highlight the challenges of engagement research including its definition, measurement, and modeling. Future engagement research that includes valid and reliable measures of engagement will enable consistent exploration of engagement predictors that can then inform methods for increasing engagement and, ultimately, intervention effectiveness.;,citation_author=Carolyn M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evaluating Machine Learning–Based Automated Personalized Daily Step Goals Delivered Through a Mobile Phone App: Randomized Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=Background: Growing evidence shows that fixed, nonpersonalized daily step goals can discourage individuals, resulting in unchanged or even reduced physical activity. Objective: The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the efficacy of an automated mobile phone–based personalized and adaptive goal-setting intervention using machine learning as compared with an active control with steady daily step goals of 10,000. Methods: In this 10-week RCT, 64 participants were recruited via email announcements and were required to attend an initial in-person session. The participants were randomized into either the intervention or active control group with a one-to-one ratio after a run-in period for data collection. A study-developed mobile phone app (which delivers daily step goals using push notifications and allows real-time physical activity monitoring) was installed on each participant’s mobile phone, and participants were asked to keep their phone in a pocket throughout the entire day. Through the app, the intervention group received fully automated adaptively personalized daily step goals, and the control group received constant step goals of 10,000 steps per day. Daily step count was objectively measured by the study-developed mobile phone app. Results: The mean (SD) age of participants was 41.1 (11.3) years, and 83% (53/64) of participants were female. The baseline demographics between the 2 groups were similar (P$&amp;amp;amp;gt;$.05). Participants in the intervention group (n=34) had a decrease in mean (SD) daily step count of 390 (490) steps between run-in and 10 weeks, compared with a decrease of 1350 (420) steps among control participants (n=30; P=.03). The net difference in daily steps between the groups was 960 steps (95% CI 90-1830 steps). Both groups had a decrease in daily step count between run-in and 10 weeks because interventions were also provided during run-in and no natural baseline was collected. Conclusions: The results showed the short-term efficacy of this intervention, which should be formally evaluated in a full-scale RCT with a longer follow-up period.

<p>Substance use disorders are chronic conditions, characterized by high relapse rates. <span class="citation" data-cites="mclellanDrugDependenceChronic2000 dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007">(<a href="#ref-dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007" role="doc-biblioref">Dennis &amp; Scott, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-mclellanDrugDependenceChronic2000" role="doc-biblioref">McLellan et al., 2000</a>)</span>, substantial co-morbidity with other physical and mental health problems <span class="citation" data-cites="substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007">(<a href="#ref-dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007" role="doc-biblioref">Dennis &amp; Scott, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed" role="doc-biblioref">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, n.d.</a>)</span>, and an increased risk of mortality <span class="citation" data-cites="hedegaardDrugOverdoseDeaths centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdcAnnualAverageUnited">(<a href="#ref-centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdcAnnualAverageUnited" role="doc-biblioref">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref-hedegaardDrugOverdoseDeaths" role="doc-biblioref">Hedegaard et al., n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>

Continuing care, including on-going monitoring, tailored adjustments to lifestyle and behaviors over time, and when necessary re-engagement with more intensive treatment, is the gold standard for treating chronic conditions, like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma.

This leaves individuals left to determine on their own “How can I best support my recovery today?”</p>
<p>This type of self-monitoring can be extremely difficult. The risk factors that precede lapse (i.e., single instances of goal-inconsistent substance use) and full relapse back to harmful use during recovery are individualized, numerous, dynamic and interactive <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007 brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007">(<a href="#ref-brandonRelapseRelapsePrevention2007" role="doc-biblioref">Brandon et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007" role="doc-biblioref">K.

Therefore, the optimal supports to address these risk factors and encourage continued, successful recovery vary both across individuals and within an individual over time.</p>
<!--could make the point then that although people arent receiving initial treatment, we  have them ready but for continuing care, we likely need to develop an entirely new system of care.-->

<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recovery-monitoring-and-support-system"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Recovery Monitoring and Support System</h2>
<p>An algorithm-guided recovery monitoring and support system could help patients monitor their current and future risk of lapse and make adjustments in their activities and supports to meet their recovery goals after initial treatment. Such a tool could offer personalized, adaptive recommendations aligned with evidenced-based care (i.e., relapse prevention model) and prompt individuals to engage with support at times of high risk. For example, individuals could receive daily messages about changes in their lapse risk and receive personalized recommendations based on top features contributing to their risk, like an urge surfing recommendation for someone with strong cravings. Moreover, it would provide a scalable option for long-term monitoring and support to address the substantial unmet need for continuing care for substance use disorders.</p>
<p>For such a system to exist, at least three pre-requisites must be met<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. One, the system must be able to collect a rich and densely sampled source (or sources) of risk-relevant data. Two, the system must have access to a model that can predict substance use with high performance and temporal precision and have interpretable model inputs for support recommendations to be mapped onto. Three, the model must perform fairly. The accuracy of the predictions and usefulness and relevance of the recommendations should be similar for everyone. Advances in both smartphone sensing <span class="citation" data-cites="mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017">(<a href="#ref-mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017" role="doc-biblioref">Mohr et al., 2017</a>)</span> and machine learning <span class="citation" data-cites="hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009">(<a href="#ref-hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009" role="doc-biblioref">Hastie et al., 2009</a>)</span> now make this possible.</p>
<p>Smartphone sensing approaches (e.g., ecological momentary assessment [EMA], geolocation sensing) can provide the frequent, longitudinal measurement of proximal risk factors that is necessary for prediction of future lapses with high temporal precision.</p>
<p>Machine learning models can handle the high dimensional feature sets that may result from feature engineering densely sampled raw EMA over time. They can also accommodate non-linear and interactive relationships between features and lapse probability. And methods from interpretable machine learning can be used to understand which risk features contribute most strongly to a lapse prediction for a specific individual at a specific moment in time.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aims-of-this-proposal"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Aims of this proposal</h2>
<p>This dissertation proposal describes a program of research that seeks to develop an algorithm to be used in a recovery monitoring and support system. Two studies (chapters 2 and 3) are completed and two studies (chapters 3 and 4) are planned and under development. These studies are explained more below:</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2:</strong> Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder</p>
<p>This study demonstrated that 4x daily EMA could be used to build temporally precise machine learning models to predict alcohol lapses. Specifically, we built three models to predict the probability of an alcohol lapse in the next week, day, and hour. Our models performed exceptionally well with median posterior probabilities for area under the ROC curve (auROC) of .90, .91, and .93 for predicting lapse probabilities into the next week, day, and hour, respectively.</p>
<p>In this study we also demonstrated it is possible to understand important features overall for a model (i.e., across all observations for all participants) and important features for an individual prediction (i.e., for a single individual at a specific moment). We found on average past use, craving, and abstinence self-efficacy were the most important features affecting predicted probability scores across the three models. We also saw a wide range of individual feature importance values across all people and all days, suggesting that even features with relative low overall importance were still clinically important for some people at some moments.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that it is feasible to identify periods of high lapse risk at varying levels of temporal precision and extract important risk features. If embedded in a recovery monitoring and support system, output from models that predict immediate lapses, like these, could be used to provide individuals critical information about their immediate risk of lapse. Daily (or more or less frequent) messages could be sent to individuals that relay information about changes in their risk and make supportive recommendations for immediate action based on the top features contributing to their risk. For example, recommending a coping with craving activity for someone experiencing strong cravings, recommending a guided relaxation video for someone reporting recent stressful events, or encouraging individuals to reflect on recent past successes or reasons for choosing abstinence or moderation when reported self-efficacy is low. Importantly, this assumes that the recommendations can be implemented immediately. Thus, the individual has already likely learned the skill and it is not contingent on scheduling or other people.</p>
<p>However, often the most clinically appropriate support recommendation takes time to set up. Scheduling positive or pleasant activities, increasing social engagement, or attending a peer-led recovery meeting may require days or weeks to implement. In these cases, patients would benefit from advanced warning about changes in their risk. This advanced warning could be obtained by lagging lapse probability predictions further into the future (e.g., predicting the probability of a lapse in a 24-hour window that begins two weeks in the future).</p>
<p>Finally, in this study, we failed to assess model fairness. In recent years, the machine learning field has begun to understand the critical importance of evaluating model fairness when algorithms are used to inform important decisions (e.g., healthcare services offered, eligibility for loans, early parole). Algorithms that perform favorably for only a single majority group could widen existing disparities in access to resources and important clinical outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="veinotGoodIntentionsAre2018">(<a href="#ref-veinotGoodIntentionsAre2018" role="doc-biblioref">Veinot et al., 2018</a>)</span>. Future studies included in this proposal will explicitly evaluate model performance parity across important subgroups.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3:</strong> Lagged predictions of next day alcohol lapse risk for personalized and adaptive continuing care support</p>
<p>This study showed that the same 4x daily EMA could be used to predict alcohol use occurring within a 24-hour window up to two weeks into the future. We considered several meaningful lags between the prediction timepoint and start of the prediction window: 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. These models with lagged prediction windows can be used to provide personalized support recommendations with the added benefit of advanced warning. Thus, giving an individual extra time to implement the recommendation.</p>
<p>Model performance decreased as the start of the prediction window was lagged further from the prediction timepoint with median posterior probabilities for auROC of .88 (1-day lag), .87 (3-day lag), .86 (1-week lag), and .84 (2-week lag). This decrease in performance is not surprising given what we know about prediction and alcohol lapse. Many important lapse risk factors are fluctuating processes that can change day-by-day, if not more frequently. As lag times increase, features become less proximal to the start of the prediction window. Still, auROCs of .80 and higher are generally considered to indicate good performance and the benefit of advanced notice of lapse risk likely outweighs the cost to performance.</p>
<p>In this study, we also assessed model fairness by comparing model performance (posterior probability for auROC) across important subgroups with known disparities in substance use treatment access and/or outcomes - race/ethnicity (not White vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White), income (below poverty vs.&nbsp;above poverty), and sex at birth (female vs.&nbsp;male). There was strong evidence that our models performed better for individuals who were non-Hispanic White, male, and had a personal income above the Federal poverty line.</p>
<p>The relative ordering of important features remained somewhat consistent across the models. Past use, future efficacy, and craving were the top three features for all models. However on average these features became less important as model predictions lagged further into the future, consistent with their lower performance. As with the previous study, we found a wide range of individual importance values for features across the models.</p>
<p>These results are promising, however, several limitations exist. Most notably was a lack of fairness in the performance of our models among subgroups. The largest contributing factor is likely the lack of diversity in our training data. Even with our coarse dichotomous grouping of race we only had 20 participants in the not White group (compared to 131 in the White group). We also saw a similar pattern in our income groups (49 people in the below poverty group compared to 102 people in the above poverty group).</p>
<p>However, we had equal representation of men and women and still found our models performed better for men. We chose our 9 EMA items based on the extant relapse risk literature. Historically women were excluded from early substance use research due to their childbearing potential. It is possible that these constructs more precisely describe relapse risk factors for men than for women.</p>
<p>One solution, would be to add additional EMA items to the daily surveys in hopes to capture important risk factors for women. This however, would quickly increase the burden of our surveys. EMA acceptability studies suggest that longer surveys, but not more frequent prompts, promote increased perceived burden and compromised data quantity and quality <span class="citation" data-cites="eiseleEffectsSamplingFrequency2020">(<a href="#ref-eiseleEffectsSamplingFrequency2020" role="doc-biblioref">Eisele et al., 2020</a>)</span>. Therefore, supplementing EMA with another lower burden sensing method may be preferred. Additionally, passive sensing data may be well-suited for data-driven (bottom-up) feature engineering approaches. Compared to traditional, theory-driven (top-down) methods, data-driven features can identify patterns and characteristics predictive of lapse in specific groups and reduce potential bias in features by minimizing researcher involvement.</p>
<p>A few other limitations were inherent in the data set. First, was the length of participation. As participants only provided data for up to three months, we were limited by how far into the future we could lag predictions. It is likely that even more advanced warning (e.g., 1 month) would be helpful for implementing more intensive supports (e.g., re-engagement with clinician-delivered care). Second, the results presented in chapters 2-3 focus on alcohol lapse prediction. Alcohol differs from other substances in several ways. It is legal and generally viewed to be socially acceptable (e.g., it is often integrated into celebrations and social gatherings). As a result, individuals who use other substances (e.g., opioids) may face more stigma and be less willing to report substance use and risk information. Therefore, it is not clear that similar prediction models will perform as well.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4:</strong> Using sensing data to predict opioid lapse risk in a national sample of patients with opioid use disorder</p>
<p>In this study, we will take advantage of an existing dataset of personal sensing data (1X daily EMA and geolocation) and opioid lapse reports from a national sample of people with opioid use disorder to predict immediate (i.e., in the next 24 hours) lapses back to opioid use.</p>
<p>This study will allow us to generalize lapse prediction algorithms to other drugs beyond alcohol. Notably, a successful model will demonstrate that lapse prediction can be done with a drug where its use is illegal and people may be less willing to provide information about lapses and risk factors.</p>
<p>These data also offer more diversity with regard to race/ethnicity and income. This will allow us to determine if improving the quality of the training data with respect to diversity is sufficient to address issues of fairness. These data also offer diversity across geographic location (e.g., rural vs.&nbsp;urban), likely another important factor in evaluating fairness.</p>
<p>In this proposed study, model features will be derived from two complementary sensing methods: 1X daily EMA and continuous geolocation data. Geolocation sensing, a passive sensing method, could compliment EMA well. It could provide insight into information difficult to measure with self-report (e.g., the amount of time spent in risky locations, or changes in routine that could indicate life stressors) or that would add additional burden by increasing the number of questions on the EMA. Furthermore, by adding more data sources gives us more features and that could mean better personalization of predictions and recommendations for more people.</p>
<p>Participants provided data for up to 12 months. This extended window of recovery (12 months vs.&nbsp;3 months) is critical for evaluating the value of an algorithm intended for ongoing continuing care support and understanding how lapse risk evolves as people progress in their recovery (i.e., past 3 months). Unfortunately, our ability to address explanatory questions about the time course of lapse risk, and how individuals might cluster on different recovery trajectories is limited with traditional machine learning methods. These methods do not capture the repeated nature of sensing data. Each lapse prediction is treated as a new independent observation. We can account for the repeated observations in our sensing data by engineering features that capture individual changes over time to produce unbiased and precise estimates of predictive performance. However, more traditional time series models are better suited for understanding the temporal dynamics of lapse risk over long periods of recovery.</p>
<p>The longer duration of participation also provides the opportunity to experiment with lagged prediction windows further than two weeks into the future (i.e., 1 month). However, in a machine learning framework, different models must be built to predict lapses at varying times in the future. For example, a recovery monitoring support system that detects both immediate lapse risk (i.e., in the next 24 hours) and future lapse risk (i.e, in the next 2 weeks and in the next month) would need three models. This approach is time consuming, cumbersome, and still only provides coarse understanding of time-course. Therefore, this study will only predict immediate lapse risk.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5:</strong> State-space models for idiographic risk monitoring and recovery support recommendations</p>
<p>In this study, we propose Hierarchical Bayesian state-space models as an alternative approach for prediction models. State-space models model measured inputs (e.g., ema responses, time spent in risky locations, time spent at home) and outputs (i.e., lapse or no lapse) from time series data with latent states. The hierarchical nature, will allow us to better use and understand time-varying information. State-space models explicitly model how the latent state of an individual’s lapse risk evolves over time.</p>
<p>Given the heterogeneity in lapse risk and the complex interactions between environment and individual differences, a time series model that use an individual’s own data to make future predictions may perform better than models trained at the group-level. Therefore, we will build an individual model for each participant using their own data. Although our immediate lapse risk models have been performing quite well, individual models could improve performance for our lagged prediction models. Individual models also may help mitigate issues of unfairness, as the model will weigh the individual’s own data more heavily than group level estimates.</p>
<p>Additionally, time series models could potentially improve the efficiency and performance of lagged prediction models. A single model can be used to predict a lapse at any point in the future, eliminating the need for multiple models for predicting immediate and future lapse risk.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this study, we will evaluate the performance and fairness of a state-space model approach for opioid lapse risk prediction using the EMA and geolocation data set introduced in Chapter 4. We will evaluate both immediate (i.e., in the next 24 hours) and future (i.e., next 2 weeks and next 1 month) lapse risk.</p>

<section id="introduction-1" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Studies show high agreement between recent (i.e., 1-4 days) self-report and biological markers (i.e., urine, saliva, hair) of drug use <span class="citation" data-cites="bharatAgreementSelfreportedIllicit2023">(<a href="#ref-bharatAgreementSelfreportedIllicit2023" role="doc-biblioref">Bharat et al., 2023</a>)</span>. This suggests people may be willing to report illicit substance use behaviors.</p>
<p>However, it is unclear if people in recovery from substance use disorders, other than alcohol, can sustain long-term adherence (e.g., one year or more) needed for a recovery monitoring support system that uses self-report data. Previous studies examining adherence to frequent self-report prompts among people with illicit substance use disorders have typically only prompted for 7-30 days <span class="citation" data-cites="jonesComplianceEcologicalMomentary2019">(<a href="#ref-jonesComplianceEcologicalMomentary2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jones et al., 2019</a>)</span> (except <span class="citation" data-cites="kennedySexDifferencesCocaine2013">Kennedy et al. (<a href="#ref-kennedySexDifferencesCocaine2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> prompted for 175 days and found 75% adherence).</p>
<p>It is also unclear whether people in recovery from illicit substance use disorders can, or are willing to, accurately report other risk information needed to develop accurate prediction models. For example, people with substance use disorders may experience greater instability in their day-to-day lives (e.g., stigma or legal consequences may make access to healthcare, stable housing, or supportive relationships more difficult). This instability could make it difficult to recall and report recent behaviors and events promptly or accurately. It may also skew their baseline perception of what constitutes a risky or stressful experience.</p>
<p>Supplementing self-report data with passively sensed data (e.g., geolocation) could make up for imprecise reports of risk factors or be used for lapse prediction during periods of non-adherence to self-report surveys. Additionally, more data will produce more features that could allow for better personalization of support recommendations.</p>
<p>This study will use daily surveys and sensed geolocation for up to one year from a national sample of people with opioid use disorder to predict immediate (i.e., in the next 24 hours) lapses back to opioid use.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="specific-aims"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Specific Aims</h2>
<p>In this study, we will expand our previous modeling procedure to opioid use disorder and evaluate performance, fairness, and top features for predicting opioid lapse risk.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will:</p>
<p><strong>1. Evaluate the performance (auROC) of a machine learning model that predicts opioid lapse risk from geolocation and daily surveys.</strong> This aim will allow us to determine whether lapse prediction models can be generalized to other drugs beyond alcohol. Notably, a successful model will demonstrate that lapse prediction can be done with a drug where its use is illegal and people may be less willing to provide information about lapses and risk factors. It will also show the feasibility of using self-report data over long periods of reocvery (i.e., 12 months).</p>
<p><strong>2. Assess model fairness in performance across important subgroups with known disparities in substance use treatment access and/or outcomes - race/ethnicity (not White vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White), income (below $25,000 vs.&nbsp;above $25,000), gender (female vs.&nbsp;male vs.&nbsp;other), and geographic location (rural vs.&nbsp;urban).</strong> These data offer more diversity with regard to race/ethnicity, income, and geographic location. This aim will allow us to determine if improving the quality of the training data with respect to diversity is sufficient to address issues of fairness.</p>
<p><strong>3. Describe the relative importance of features on model performance.</strong> Model features will be derived from two complementary sensing methods: daily surveys and continuous geolocation data. Geolocation sensing, a passive sensing method, could compliment daily surveys well. It could provide insight into information difficult to measure with self-report (e.g., the amount of time spent in risky locations, or changes in routine that could indicate life stressors) or that would add additional burden by increasing the number of questions on the daily surveys. Furthermore, by adding more data sources gives us more features and that could mean better personalization of predictions and recommendations for more people. This aim will help determine whether a sufficient number of unique important features emerge from these data.</p>

<p>We recruited participants in early recovery from opioid use disorder. Participants were recruited through print and targeted digital advertisements (craigslist, reddit, Facebook) and partnerships with MOUD treatment centers. We required that participants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>were age 18 or older,</li>
<li>could write, speak, and read in English,</li>
<li>enrolled in an MOUD treatment program (for at least one month but not longer than 12 months) and adherent (taken daily medication every day or nearly every day in past month) or enrolled in or recently completed an intensive outpatient treatment program for opioid use disorder,</li>
<li>had a goal of abstinence from opioids,</li>
<li>had an android smartphone that they were willing to use as their single phone for duration of the study, and</li>
<li>had active cellular plan that they were willing to maintain for duration of the study.</li>
</ol>
<p>Participants were considered enrolled in the study if they were eligible, consented, and provided data for at least one month. A total of 336 participants enrolled in the study. We excluded data from one participant whose geolocation data showed they did not reside in the US. We also excluded 11 participants due to careless responding on the daily surveys and/or lapses reported nearly every day on study, suggesting they did not have a goal of abstinence. Our final sample consisted of 324 participants.</p>

<p>Participants who screened eligible were consented and onboarded over video or phone call. All participants were instructed to download the STARR study app (a version of CHESS). After this meeting participants were instructed to watch a set of video tutorials for learning how to use the app. One week later they participated in a check-in video or phone call with study staff to answer any questions about the app and troubleshoot any technical issues. At this time, study staff also mailed onboarding materials to participants, including a payment card. Participants were expected to complete monthly surveys to remain on study. At the end of the study participants met with study staff for a final debriefing video or phone call.</p>

<p>We collected self-report information about demographics (age, gender, orientation, race/ethnicity, education, employment, income, relationship status, location) and clinical characteristics (DSM-5 OUD symptom count, MOUD medication, number of lifetime overdoses) to characterize our sample. Demographic information will be included as features in our models. A subset of these variables (gender, race/ethnicity, income, and location) will be used for model fairness analyses, as they have documented disparities in treatment access and outcomes.</p>
<p>As part of the aims of the parent project we collected many other trait and state measures throughout the study. A complete list of all measures will be made available on our study’s OSF page.</p>

<p>Participants completed one brief (16 questions) daily survey. Daily surveys became available in star app each morning at 6 am. The survey remind open until 5:59 am the next day. Push notifications were also sent to participants to remind them that they had a new task that had not been completed yet.</p>
<p>On each survey, participants reported dates/times of any previously unreported past opioid use. They also reported any other drugs or alcohol used in the past 24 hours and whether they took their MOUD as prescribed. Next, participants rated the maximum intensity of recent (i.e., since last EMA) experiences of pain, craving, risky situations, stressful events, and pleasant events. Next, participants rated their sleep and how depressed, angry, anxious, relaxed, and happy they have felt in the past 24 hours. Finally, participants rated how motivated they were to completely avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons and how confident they were in their ability to completely avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons.</p>
<p>Participants were withdrawn early from the study if they did not complete at least 20 daily surveys in a four week period.</p>

<p>Monthly surveys consisted of several clinical scales as part of the parent project’s aims. The monthly survey was also personalized to ask a series of questions about participants’ frequent locations (identified by geolocation sensing - see Sensed Geolocation section below). For locations that participants visited twice in a month, they were asked to identify the type of location, what they do there, how pleasant and unpleasant their experience is there, and how much this place helps and harms their recovery from opioids.</p>
<p>Participants were withdrawn early from the study if they missed three monthly surveys.</p>

<p>Continuous sensed geolocation was collected through the STARR app. Geolocation was contextualized by asking questions about frequently visited locations in each monthly survey (see Monthly Surveys section above).</p>
<p>Participants were shown how to temporarily turn off sharing geolocation with us. However, participants were expected to share their location with the STARR app and were withdrawn from the study if they did consistently provide geolocation data (i.e., disabling location sharing for more than 12 hours in a four-week period).</p>

<p>Features will be derived from four sources:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Prediction window: We will dummy-code features for day of the week for the start of the prediction window.</p></li>
<li><p>Demographics: We will create dummy-coded features for age (18-25 years, 26-35 years, 36-45 years, 46-55 years, 56 years or older), personal income (less than $25,000, more than $25,000), gender (male, female, other), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White vs.&nbsp;not White), geographic location (urban, rural), relationship status (in committed relationship, not in committed relationsip), education (high school or less, some college, college degree), and employment (employed, not employed).</p></li>
<li><p>Previous daily survey responses: We will create raw and change features using daily surveys in varying feature scoring epochs (i.e., 48, 72, and 168 hours) before the start of the prediction window for all daily survey items. Raw features will include min, max, and median scores for each daily survey item across all daily surveys in each epoch for that participant. We will also calculate change features by subtracting each participant’s baseline mean score for each daily survey item from their raw feature. These baseline mean scores will be calculated using all of their daily surveys collected from the start of their participation until the start of the prediction window. We also will create raw and change features based on the most recent response for each daily survey question and raw and change rate features from previously reported lapses and number of completed daily surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>Geolocation data: We will calculate raw and change features for time spent in locations harmful to recovery, time spent in locations helpful for recovery, time spent in pleasant locations, time spent in unpleasant locations, location variance, type of location, and activity done at location over varying feature scoring epochs (i.e., 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other generic feature engineering steps will include imputing missing data (median imputation for numeric features, mode imputation for nominal features) and removing zero and near-zero variance features as determined from held-in data (see Cross-validation section below).</p>

<p>We will use participant-grouped, nested cross-validation for model training, selection, and evaluation with auROC. auROC indexes the probability that the model will predict a higher score for a randomly selected positive case (lapse) relative to a randomly selected negative case (no lapse). Grouped cross-validation assigns all data from a participant as either held-in or held-out to avoid bias introduced when predicting a participant’s data from their own data. We will use 1 repeat of 10-fold cross-validation for the inner loops (i.e., validation sets) and 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation for the outer loop (i.e., test sets). Best model configurations will be selected using median auROC across the 10 validation sets.

<p>We will use a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) from the 30 held-out test sets for our best model. We will use the rstanarm default autoscaled, weakly informative, data-dependent priors that take into account the order of magnitude of the variables to provide some regularization to stabilize computation and avoid over-fitting.

<p>From the Bayesian model we will obtain the posterior distribution and Bayeisan CI for auROCs our best model. To evaluate our models’ overall performance we will report the median posterior probability for auROC and Bayesian CI. This represents our best estimate for the magnitude of the auROC parameter.

<p>We will calculate Shapley values in log-odds units for binary classification models from the 30 test sets to provide a description of the importance of categories of features across our best model. We will average the three Shapley values for each observation for each feature (i.e., across the three repeats) to increase their stability. An inherent property of Shapley values is their additivity, allowing us to combine features into feature categories. We will create separate feature categories for each of the 15 daily survey questions, past opioid use, missing daily surveys, time spent in risky locations, and time spent at known locations (separate by type of location). We will calculate the local (i.e., for each observation) importance for each category of features by adding Shapley values across all features in a category, separately for each observation. We will calculate global importance for each feature category by averaging the absolute value of the Shapley values of all features in the category across all observations. These local and global importance scores based on Shapley values allow us to contextualize relative feature importance for our model.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-2"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Lapse risk is multidimensional. The extant relapse prevention literature suggests relapse is preceeded by a complex interplay of factors, including include emotional or cognitive states, environmental contingencies, and physiological states <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007 witkiewitzTherapistsGuideEvidenceBased2007">(<a href="#ref-witkiewitzTherapistsGuideEvidenceBased2007" role="doc-biblioref">K. A. Witkiewitz &amp; Marlatt, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007" role="doc-biblioref">K. Witkiewitz &amp; Marlatt, 2007</a>)</span>. For reasons related to burden and cost, researchers typically rely on a handful of course categories of risk-relevant features (e.g., self-reported craving, self-reported self-efficacy, geolocation-sensed time spent in risky locations) to model an unknown hidden state of an individual (i.e., their true lapse risk).</p>
<p>Moreover, lapse risk factors differ between individuals and within an individual over time. Personalized models (i.e., a model built for a specific individual using their own data) that make use of time-varying information in repeated measures may be able to better understand between and within subject differences in lapse risk trajectories, leading to more accurate predictions.</p>
<p>State-space models may be one approach for modeling the multidimensional, heterogeneous, and time-varying construct of lapse risk. State-space models are time series models that describe the relationship between the observed measured inputs and the unknown latent state while accounting for how this latent state evolves over time. They personalize lapse risk prediction by using an individual’s own data to make future predictions about lapse risk for that single individual. Furthermore, predictions can be made at any point into the future at a single prediction timepoint from a single model. These individual models that integrate time-varying information could improve performance for our lagged prediction models. They may also help mitigate issues of unfairness, as the model will weigh the individual’s own data more heavily than group level estimates.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="specific-aims-1"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Specific Aims</h2>
<p>In this study, we will evaluate the performance and fairness of a hierarchichal Gaussian linear state-space model (also known as a dynamic linear model) for opioid lapse risk prediction using the same daily survey and geolocation data introduced in study 3 (Chapter 4).</p>
<p>Specifically, we will:</p>
<p><strong>1. Evaluate the performance (auROC) of personalized state-space models that predict immediate (next day) opioid lapse risk from geolocation and daily surveys.</strong> This aim will allow us to assess how individual models that account for time-varying models perform over time (i.e., each month for up to 12 months). We will be evaluating state-space models independently in this study, however, model performance achieved in study 3 can be used as a benchmark for comparison.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use the same models from Aim 1 to evaluate their performance for predicting future lapse risk (i.e., lapse risk in the next two weeks and the next month).</strong> A benefit of time series models, like state-space models, is that they could potentially improve the efficiency and performance of lagged prediction models (compared to traditional machine learning approaches). A single model can be used to predict a lapse in the next day or at any point in the future. We will evaluate how well our individual models predict lapse risk two weeks and one month into the future.</p>
<p><strong>3. Assess model fairness in model performance for immediate lapses across the same important subgroups assessed in study 3 - race/ethnicity (not White vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White), income (below $25,000 vs.&nbsp;above $25,000), gender (female vs.&nbsp;male vs.&nbsp;other), and geographic location (rural vs.&nbsp;urban).</strong> Individual models may help mitigate issues of unfairness, seen in our previous group-level machine learning models, as the model will weigh the individual’s own data more heavily than group level estimates. Therefore, we will compare state-space model performance across different groups.</p>

<p>State-space models consist of 1. a transition (or state) equation that describes how the latent state evolves over time based on its previous state and observed inputs (e.g., daily surveys, geolocation risk score), and 2. an observation equation that describes the functional relationship between the unobserved, latent states and observed inputs.</p>
<p>For both equations, we will use a linear formula with Gaussian noise.</p>
<p><strong>Transition equation:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x_{t+1} = A*x_{t} + w_t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x_{t+1}\)</span> represents the hidden state at the next timepoint, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the state transition matrix, <span class="math inline">\(x_{t}\)</span> is the hidden state at the current timepoint, and <span class="math inline">\(w_t\)</span> is zero mean Gaussian noise.</p>
<p><strong>Observation equation:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(y_t = C*x_t + v_t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> is the observed survey and Geolocation inputs, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the observation matrix, <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> is the hidden state at the current timepoint and <span class="math inline">\(v_t\)</span> is zero mean Gaussian noise.</p>
<p>We will also assign prior distributions to all individual- and population-level model parameters, consistent with a Bayesian approach. We will use a Bayseian fitting approach called maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to establish prior distributions for the model parameters: transition matrix (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>), observation matrix (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>), and noise (<span class="math inline">\(w_t\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(v_t\)</span>). These priors will be established from held-in data. Parameters and noise variance will be estimated for each individual in the held out data. Thus, model priors will be combined with observed data from a new individual to fit an idiographic model for that individual. When few data for the individual are available, the fit will rely more heavily on the prior distributions for the model parameters. As more data become available the model fit will primarily the participant’s data and the influence of the prior distributions diminishes.</p>
<p>State-space models use the observed data to estimate the unknown latent states, not to directly predict the outcome label. Therefore, state-space models can handle missing data without the need for imputation.</p>

The predictors, or model inputs, will be the raw daily survey responses and a single geolocation risk score (calculated from the previous 24 hours of geolocation data).

<p>We will use participant-grouped 3 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation to assess model performance using area under the ROC curve (auROC). Grouped cross-validation assigns assigns all data from a participant into a single fold. Data from individuals in the held-in folds will be used to fit prior distributions for the model parameters.</p>
<p>Individual models will then be fit to each individual in the held-out fold. We will attach the group-level Bayesian priors generated from the held-in participants to help prevent over-fitting and improve stability of the models’ performance. Each individual model will output a predicted probability of lapse in the next day, in a 24-hour window two weeks from the prediction timepoint, and in a 24-hour window one month from the prediction timepoint.</p>
<p>Models will be evaluated separately for each prediction lag duration (immediate/no lag, 2-week lag, 1-month lag). We will aggregate prediction accuracy across held-out participants at 12 different timepoints (months 1-12). We will use a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate the posterior probability distributions and 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) from the 30 held-out test sets at each model evaluation timepoint for each lag. We will use the rstanarm default autoscaled, weakly informative, data-dependent priors and set two random intercepts to account for our resampling method: one for the repeat, and another for the fold nested within repeat. We will report the median posterior probability for auROC and Bayesian CI at all 12 model evaluation timepoints for each lag.</p>

<h4 data-number="5.3.1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-fairness"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1.4</span> Model Fairness</h4>
<p>We will calculate the median posterior probability and 95% Bayesian CI for auROC for our immediate model separately by race/ethnicity (not White vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic White), income (below $25,000 vs.&nbsp;above $25,000), gender (female vs.&nbsp;male vs.&nbsp;other), and location (rural vs.&nbsp;urban) at each model evaluation timepoint (months 1-12). We will conduct Bayesian group comparisons to assess the likelihood that each model performs differently by group. We will report the precise posterior probability for the difference in auROCs and the 95% Bayesian CIs for each model comparison.</p>
