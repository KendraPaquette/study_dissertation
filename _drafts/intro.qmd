# Introduction

## Substance Use Disorders

In 2023, over 46 million U.S. adults had a substance use disorder in the past year [@substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed]. This is nearly 18% of the U.S. adult population.

Substance use disorders are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Opioid overdose rates remain high and continue to increase each year [@IncreasesDrugOpioid; @friedmanTrendsDrugOverdose2022]. Excessive alcohol use is a leading preventable cause of death, with the majority of these deaths caused by alcohol-attributed cancer, heart problems and stroke, and liver cirrhosis [@ARDIAlcoholAttributableDeaths]. Additionally, alcohol-impaired driving accounts for over 30% of traffic fatalities each year [@unitedstatesdepartmentoftransportation2024].  

The economic cost of substance use disorders is substantial. In 2016 the economic cost associated with substance use disorders was estimated to exceed \$442 billion in lost productivity, health care expenses, law enforcement, and other criminal justice costs [@substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministrationusFacingAddictionAmerica2016]. When also accounting for costs associated with loss of life and reduced quality of life, one research group estimated that in 2017 the cost of opioid use disorder alone exceeded \$1 trillion [@florenceEconomicBurdenOpioid2021]. 


## Continuing Care

Evidence-based treatments for substance use disorders exist (e.g., relapse prevention [@marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985; @marlattRelapsePreventionSecond2007], mindfulness-based relapse prevention [@bowenMindfulnessBasedRelapsePrevention2021], and cognitive-behavioral therapy [@lieseCognitiveBehavioralTherapyAddictive2022]). Unfortunately, less than 15% of individuals with a substance use disorder receive treatment [@substanceabuseandmentalhealthservicesadministration2023NSDUHDetailed]. 

Substance use disorders are chronic relapsing conditions. As with other chronic health conditions, ongoing monitoring and support is necessary for symptom management. Substance use treatment has been shown to be most effective when care is prescribed over longer durations (e.g., at least 12 months) and involves active efforts to keep patients engaged [@mckayImpactContinuingCare2021]. Yet, for reasons including cost and insurance reimbursement issues, lack of collaborative provider teams, passive referral processes, geographic barriers to accessing services, patient dropout, and changes in the patientâ€™s clinical needs over time, most treatment is time-limited and aimed at acute substance use reduction and symptom stabilization [@dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007; @taiTreatmentSubstanceUse2013; @mckayImpactContinuingCare2021; @stanojlovicTargetingBarriersSubstance2021]  This leaves a large treatment gap when it comes to long-term continuing care for substance use disorders [@stanojlovicTargetingBarriersSubstance2021; @sociasAdoptingCascadeCare2016]. 

## Recovery Monitoring and Support System

An algorithm-guided recovery monitoring and support system could help patients without access to traditional continuing care services self-monitor their risk for relapse. Such a tool could provide a scalable option for low-cost, long-term monitoring; offer personalized, adaptive recommendations aligned with evidenced-based care (i.e., relapse prevention model); prompt individuals to engage with support at times of high risk; and reduce geographic and resource-related (public funding, clinician availability) barriers. 

For such a system to exist, two pre-requisites must be met. One, the system must be able to collect a rich and densely sampled source (or sources) of risk-relevant data. Two, the system must have access to a model that can predict substance use with high performance and have interpretable model inputs for support recommendations to be mapped onto. Advances in both smartphone sensing [@mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017] and machine learning [@hastieElementsStatisticalLearning2009] now make this possible. Smartphone sensing approaches (e.g., ecological momentary assessment [EMA], geolocation sensing) can provide the frequent, longitudinal measurement of proximal risk factors that is necessary for prediction of future lapses with high temporal precision. 

Machine learning models can handle the high dimensional feature sets that may result from feature engineering densely sampled raw EMA over time. They can also accommodate non-linear and interactive relationships between features and lapse probability.  And methods from interpretable machine learning can be used to understand which risk features contribute most strongly to a lapse prediction for a specific individual at a specific moment in time.

Of course, these are not the only things needed for a successful recovery monitoring support system. For example, people must be willing and able to provide sensing data and the system must able to provide risk-relevant feedback to the individual in a useful and clinically helpful way. While important, these questions are outside the scope of the current proposal (see @wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023 and @wyantOptimizingMessageComponentsinprep).


## Aims of this proposal

This dissertation proposal provides an initial line of research for developing an algorithm to be used in a recovery monitoring support system. Two projects (chapters 2 and 3) are completed and two projects (chapters 3 and 4) are proposed future directions. These projects are explained more below:

 - **Chapter 2:** Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder 


     This project demonstrated that we could use 4x daily EMA to build temporally precise machine learning models to predict alcohol lapses. Specifically, we built three models to predict the probability of an alcohol lapse in the next hour, in the next day, and the next week. These models that predict immediate lapses can be used to provide personalized support recommendations to address immediate risks for possible lapses. Models can be updated each day to provide individuals information about changes in their risk and make supportive recommendations based on the top features contributing to their risk. For example, recommending a coping with craving activity when someone has increased craving. Importantly, this assumes that the recommendations can be implemented immediately and that the individual has already learned the skill.   

    However, many appropriate support recommendations take time to set up, and are not available in the moment (e.g., attending a self-help meeting, planning an outing with important people in their life, or scheduling an appointment with a therapist). In these cases, patients would benefit from advanced warning about changes in their risk. This advanced warning could be obtained by lagging lapse probability predictions further into the future (e.g., predicting lapse probability in a 24-hour window that begins two weeks in the future). 


- **Chapter 3:**  Lagged predictions of next day alcohol use for personalized and adaptive continuing care support

    This project showed that we could use the same 4x daily EMA to predict alcohol use occurring within a 24-hour window up to two weeks into the future. We considered several meaningful lags for prediction windows: 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. These models with lagged prediction windows can also be used to provide personalized support recommendations, but with the added benefit of advanced warning. Thus, giving an individual extra time to implement the recommendation.

    The models were promising, however, limitations exist. Most notably was a lack of fairness in the performance of our models between demographic subgroups. Our models performed better for individuals who were White, male, and had a personal income above the Federal poverty line. 


- **Chapter 4:** Using sensing data to predict opioid use in a national sample of patients with opioid use disorder

    This project will build on the previous projects and address the noted limitations above in several ways. First and foremost this project will use a new dataset. Data come from a personal sensing study for opioid lapse in a national sample of participants with opioid use disorder. These data offer more diversity with regard to race/ethnicity, income, and geographic location. We expect a more representative dataset will help mitigate some of the fairness discrepancies seen in our race/ethnicity and income subgroup comparisons.

    Second, this project will extend the past work to other substance use disorders. While there may be some small differences in risk factors for opioid vs alcohol use disorder. Treatment and continuing care is largely the same. 

    Third, data were collected from individuals for 12 months. This is extended window is critical for understanding the value of algorithm-guided continuing care systems, as recovery is an ongoing process. The longer duration of participation will also give us the chance to experiment with lagged prediction windows further than two weeks into the future (i.e., no lag, 2-week, and 4-week lag).

    Fourth, in this proposed project, model features will be derived from two complementary sensing methods: 1X daily EMA and continuous geolocation data. Geolocation is a passive sensing method that could compliment EMA well. It could provide insight into information difficult to measure with self-report (e.g., the amount of time spent in risky locations, or changes in routine that could indicate life stressors) or that would add additional burden by increasing the number of questions on the EMA. Furthermore, by adding more data sources gives us more features and that could mean better personalization of predictions and recommendations for more people.

    An anticipated limitation of the above machine learning approach is the computational expense of building several models to predict probabilities of lapse at varying times in the future. Better yet would be a single model that could look as far into the future as desired.
    
    Additionally, while we can engineer features to capture individual change in important predictors, machine learning models remain a nomothetic approach. Given the heterogeneity in lapse risk and the complex interactions between environment and individual differences, an idiographic approach to lapse prediction may be better suited for tailoring recovery support recommendations.


- **Chapter 5:** State-space models for idiographic risk monitoring and recovery support recommendations

    Hierarchical Bayesian state-space models may be one promising approach for idiographic prediction models. State-space models model measured inputs (e.g., ema responses, time spent in risky locations, time spent at home) and outputs (i.e., lapse or no lapse) from time series data with latent states. Using state-space models in a Hierarchichal Bayesian framework, allows for key parameters to differ for each participant. Moreover, the latent states can be extracted from the model (e.g., using the Kalman filter) and used for understanding lapse risk and recommending the most appropriate recovery tool. Finally, a single state-space model can be used to make a prediction of a lapse at any point in the future (i.e., for any lapse observation), eliminating the need for multiple models. In this project, we will evaluate the performance and fairness of a state-space model. We will also assess the usability of latent states as intervenable targets for recommendations.
    
    
*Note: I ended up separating the traditional and state space models into separate chapters. I think the discussion chapter will be a good space to make comparisons between the approaches, instead of trying to do it all in one chapter.*
